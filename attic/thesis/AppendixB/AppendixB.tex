            {Free-energy surface from metadynamics simulations of GDP release for the full G$\alpha$q (blue) and truncated form (green, without the last five C-terminal residues). Both sets of simulations were run for the same amount of time with identical collective variables. The rate-limiting step as identified from the highest flux pathway is marked with a dashed line. The free-energy difference between the GDP-bound states of the two systems is marked with a bracket.}

At each point, the combined population (represented by the color scale) of that state is shown using both GDP-bound and intermediate stages of the GDP release pathway. H5 vertical motion was measured by computing the distance between Thr334$^{G.H5.1}$ on the s6h5 loop and Phe341$^{G.H5.8}$ on H5. GDP release distance was measured as the distance from GDP $\beta$-phosphate to the center of mass between residues Lys52$^{G.H1.1}$, Ser53$^{G.H1.2}$, and Thr54$^{G.H1.3}$ on H1.}
