abstract = {Life is fundamentally a nonequilibrium phenomenon. At the expense of dissipated energy, living things perform irreversible processes that allow them to propagate and reproduce. Within cells, evolution has designed nanoscale machines to do meaningful work with energy harnessed from a continuous flux of heat and particles. As dictated by the Second Law of Thermodynamics and its fluctuation theorem corollaries, irreversibility in nonequilibrium processes can be quantified in terms of how much entropy such dynamics produce. In this work, we seek to address a fundamental question linking biology and nonequilibrium physics: can the evolved dissipative pathways that facilitate biomolecular function be identified by their extent of entropy production in general relaxation processes? We here synthesize massive molecular dynamics simulations, Markov state models (MSMs), and nonequilibrium statistical mechanical theory to probe dissipation in two key classes of signaling proteins: kinases and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Applying machinery from large deviation theory, we use MSMs constructed from protein simulations to generate dynamics conforming to positive levels of entropy production. We note the emergence of an array of peaks in the dynamical response (transient analogs of phase transitions) that draw the proteins between distinct levels of dissipation, and we see that the binding of ATP and agonist molecules modifies the observed dissipative landscapes. Overall, we find that dissipation is tightly coupled to activation in these signaling systems: dominant entropy-producing trajectories become localized near important barriers along known biological activation pathways. We go on to classify an array of equilibrium and nonequilibrium molecular switches that harmonize to promote functional dynamics.},

abstract = {The examination of three-dimensional structural models in scientific publications allows the reader to validate or invalidate conclusions drawn by the authors. However, either due to a (temporary) lack of access to proper visualization software or a lack of proficiency, this information is not necessarily available to every reader. As the digital revolution is quickly progressing, technologies have become widely available that overcome the limitations and offer to all the opportunity to appreciate models not only in 2D, but also in 3D. Additionally, mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets allow access to this information almost anywhere, at any time. Since access to such information has only recently become standard practice, we want to outline straightforward ways to incorporate 3D models in augmented reality into scientific publications, books, posters, and presentations and suggest that this should become general practice.},

abstract = {Receptor-mediated Gq signaling promotes hypertrophic growth of cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes and is postulated to transduce in vivo cardiac pressure overload hypertrophy. Although initially compensatory, hypertrophy can proceed by unknown mechanisms to cardiac failure. We used adenoviral infection and transgenic overexpression of the alpha subunit of Gq to autonomously activate Gq signaling in cardiomyocytes. In cultured cardiac myocytes, overexpression of wild-type Galphaq resulted in hypertrophic growth. Strikingly, expression of a constitutively activated mutant of Galphaq, which further increased Gq signaling, produced initial hypertrophy, which rapidly progressed to apoptotic cardiomyocyte death. This paradigm was recapitulated during pregnancy in Galphaq overexpressing mice and in transgenic mice expressing high levels of wild-type Galphaq. The consequence of cardiomyocyte apoptosis was a transition from compensated hypertrophy to a rapidly progressive and lethal cardiomyopathy. Progression from hypertrophy to apoptosis in vitro and in vivo was coincident with activation of p38 and Jun kinases. These data suggest a mechanism in which moderate levels of Gq signaling stimulate cardiac hypertrophy whereas high level Gq activation results in cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The identification of a single biochemical stimulus regulating cardiomyocyte growth and death suggests a plausible mechanism for the progression of compensated hypertrophy to decompensated heart failure.},

abstract = {Many proteins in their unbound structures lack surface pockets appropriately sized for drug binding. Hence, a variety of experimental and computational tools have been developed for the identification of cryptic sites that are not evident in the unbound protein but form upon ligand binding, and can provide tractable drug target sites. The goal of this review is to discuss the definition, detection, and druggability of such sites, and their potential value for drug discovery. Novel methods based on molecular dynamics simulations are particularly promising and yield a large number of transient pockets, but it has been shown that only a minority of such sites are generally capable of binding ligands with substantial affinity. Based on recent studies, current methodology can be improved by combining molecular dynamics with fragment docking and machine learning approaches.},

abstract = {The theory of statistical mechanics pioneered by Boltzmann has enabled predictive understanding of a wide range of physical systems that are at thermal equilibrium. Understanding how living systems function at the microscopic scale requires an equally powerful theory of far-from- equilibrium behavior. Such a theory has so far been lacking. Here, I generalize the Boltzmann distribution to enable calculation of microstate probabilities and fluxes for systems that are driven, time-dependent, and/or are not at steady state; at equilibrium, the equation reduces to the Boltzmann distribution. The derived equation is an isomorphic mapping between any network of microstates to an equivalent electrical circuit with resistors and voltage- dependent voltage sources. This mapping allows for the application of powerful theorems from circuit theory to nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, from which they take on new meaning, such as maximum efficiency and reciprocal relations arbitrarily far from equilibrium. These relations are obeyed by driven steady state systems in general, and therefore govern biological performance, response, and evolvability. The resistors can be systematically coarse-grained to simplify the analysis of complex systems, as well as to deduce microscopic thermodynamic information like free energy barriers from measurements of macroscopic observables like dissipation rate or motility. As concrete examples, the single-cycle microstate topology with one and two driving sources, which describe protein catalysis and activation, respectively, are solved analytically. In these cases, being driven far from equilibrium allows function to be optimized independently of stability.},

abstract = {Molecular simulations of systems with multiple copies of identical atoms or molecules may require the biasing of numerous, degenerate collective variables (CVs) to accelerate sampling. Recently, a variation of metadynamics (MetaD) named parallel bias metadynamics (PBMetaD) has been shown to make biasing of many CVs more tractable. We extended the PBMetaD scheme so that it partitions degenerate CVs into families that share the same bias potential, consequently expediting convergence of the free-energy landscape. We tested our method, named Parallel Bias MetaD with Partitioned Families, on 3, 21, and 78 CV systems and obtained an approximately proportional increase in convergence speed compared to standard PBMetaD.},

abstract = {TEM-1 $\beta$-lactamase is one of the most well-known antibiotic resistance determinants around. It confers resistance to penicillins and early cephalosporins and has shown an astonishing functional plasticity in response to the introduction of novel drugs derived from these antibiotics. Since its discovery in the 1960s, over 170 variants of TEM-1 - with different amino acid sequences and often resistance phenotypes - have been isolated in hospitals and clinics worldwide. Next to this well-documented 'natural' evolution, the in vitro evolution of TEM-1 has been the focus of attention of many experimental studies. In this review, we compare the natural and laboratory evolution of TEM-1 in order to address the question to what extent the evolution of antibiotic resistance can be repeated, and hence might have been predicted, under laboratory conditions. We also use the comparison to gain an insight into the adaptive relevance of hitherto uncharacterized substitutions present in clinical isolates and to predict substitutions not yet observed in nature. Based on new structural insights, we review what is known about substitutions in TEM-1 that contribute to the extension of its resistance phenotype. Finally, we address the clinical relevance of TEM alleles during the past decade, which has been dominated by the emergence of another $\beta$-lactamase, CTX-M.},

Of the K-Ras mutants, only K-RasG12D and K-RasQ61H are available in the PDB representing the activated form of the GTPase not in complex with other proteins. We present the crystal structure of wild-type K-Ras bound to the GTP analog GppCH2p, with K-Ras in the state~1 conformation. Signatures of conformational states obtained by one-dimensional proton NMR confirm that K-Ras has a more substantial population of state~1 in solution than H-Ras, which predominantly favors state 2. The oncogenic mutant K-RasG12D favors state 2, changing the balance of conformational states in favor of interactions with effector proteins. Differences in the population of conformational states between K-Ras and H-Ras, as well as between K-Ras and its mutants, can provide a structural basis for focused targeting of the K-Ras isoform in cancer-specific strategies.},

abstract = {We consider the probability distribution for fluctuations in dynamical action and similar quantities related to dynamic heterogeneity. We argue that the so-called "glass transition" is a manifestation of low action tails in these distributions where the entropy of trajectory space is subextensive in time. These low action tails are a consequence of dynamic heterogeneity and an indication of phase coexistence in trajectory space. The glass transition, where the system falls out of equilibrium, is then an order-disorder phenomenon in space-time occurring at a temperature T(g), which is a weak function of measurement time. We illustrate our perspective ideas with facilitated lattice models and note how these ideas apply more generally.},

abstract = {G$\alpha$16 can activate phospholipase C$\beta$ (PLC$\beta$) directly like G$\alpha$q. It also couples to tetratricopeptide repeat 1 (TPR1) which is linked to Ras activation. It is unknown whether PLC$\beta$ and TPR1 interact with the same regions on G$\alpha$16. Previous studies on G$\alpha$q have defined two minimal clusters of amino acids that are essential for the coupling to PLC$\beta$. Cognate residues in G$\alpha$16 might also be essential for interacting with PLC$\beta$, and possibly contribute to TPR1 interaction and other signaling events. Alanine mutations were introduced to the two amino acid clusters (246{\textendash}248 and 259{\textendash}260) in the switch III region and $\alpha$3 helix of G$\alpha$16. Regulations of PLC$\beta$ and STAT3 were partially weakened by each cluster mutant. A mutant harboring mutations at both clusters generally produced stronger suppressions. Activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) by G$\alpha$16 was completely abolished by mutating either clusters. Contrastingly, phosphorylations of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and nuclear factor $\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B) were not significantly affected by these mutations. The interactions between the mutants and PLC$\beta$2 and TPR1 were also reduced in co-immunoprecipitation assays. Coupling between G16 and different categories of receptors was impaired by the mutations, with the effect of switch III mutations being more pronounced than those in the $\alpha$3 helix. Mutations of both clusters almost completely abolished the receptor coupling and prevent receptor-induced G$\beta$$\gamma$ release. The integrity of the switch III region and $\alpha$3 helix of G$\alpha$16 is critical for the activation of PLC$\beta$, STAT3, and JNK but not ERK or NF-$\kappa$B. Binding of G$\alpha$16 to PLC$\beta$2 or TPR1 was reduced by the mutations of either cluster. The same region could also differentially affect the effectiveness of receptor coupling to G16. The studied region was shown to bear multiple functionally important roles of G16.},

abstract = {Detailed understanding of how conformational dynamics orchestrates function in allosteric regulation of recognition and catalysis remains ambiguous. Here, we simulate CypA using multiple-microsecond-long atomistic molecular dynamics in explicit solvent and carry out NMR experiments. We analyze a large amount of time-dependent multidimensional data with a coarse-grained approach and map key dynamical features within individual macrostates by defining dynamics in terms of residue-residue contacts. The effects of substrate binding are observed to be largely sensed at a location over 15 {\AA} from the active site, implying its importance in allostery. Using NMR experiments, we confirm that a dynamic cluster of residues in this distal region is directly coupled to the active site. Furthermore, the dynamical network of interresidue contacts is found to be coupled and temporally dispersed, ranging over 4 to 5 orders of magnitude. Finally, using network centrality measures we demonstrate the changes in the communication network, connectivity, and influence of CypA residues upon substrate binding, mutation, and during catalysis. We identify key residues that potentially act as a bottleneck in the communication flow through the distinct regions in CypA and, therefore, as targets for future mutational studies. Mapping these dynamical features and the coupling of dynamics to function has crucial ramifications in understanding allosteric regulation in enzymes and proteins, in general.},

RNN models capture patterns in sequential data and generate new data instances from the learned context. Amino acid sequences represent a suitable input for these machine-learning models. Generative models trained on peptide sequences could therefore facilitate the design of bespoke peptide libraries. We trained RNNs with LSTM units on pattern recognition of helical antimicrobial peptides and used the resulting model for de novo sequence generation. Of these sequences, 82% were predicted to be active antimicrobial peptides compared to 65% of randomly sampled sequences with the same amino acid distribution as the training set. The generated sequences also lie closer to the training data than manually designed amphipathic helices. The results of this study showcase the ability of LSTM RNNs to construct new amino acid sequences within the applicability domain of the model and motivate their prospective application to peptide and protein design without the need for the exhaustive enumeration of sequence libraries.},

abstract = {The statistical analysis of molecular dynamics simulations requires dimensionality reduction techniques, which yield a low-dimensional set of collective variables (CVs) {xi} = x that in some sense describe the essential dynamics of the system. Considering the distribution P(x) of the CVs, the primal goal of a statistical analysis is to detect the characteristic features of P(x), in particular, its maxima and their connection paths. This is because these features characterize the low-energy regions and the energy barriers of the corresponding free energy landscape $\Delta$G(x) = {\textminus}kBT ln P(x), and therefore amount to the metastable states and transition regions of the system. In this perspective, we outline a systematic strategy to identify CVs and metastable states, which subsequently can be employed to construct a Langevin or a Markov state model of the dynamics.

abstract = {Accurate mechanistic description of structural changes in biomolecules is an increasingly important topic in structural and chemical biology. Markov models have emerged as a powerful way to approximate the molecular kinetics of large biomolecules while keeping full structural resolution in a divide-and-conquer fashion. However, the accuracy of these models is limited by that of the force fields used to generate the underlying molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. Whereas the quality of classical MD force fields has improved significantly in recent years, remaining errors in the Boltzmann weights are still on the order of a few [Formula: see text], which may lead to significant discrepancies when comparing to experimentally measured rates or state populations. Here we take the view that simulations using a sufficiently good force-field sample conformations that are valid but have inaccurate weights, yet these weights may be made accurate by incorporating experimental data a posteriori. To do so, we propose augmented Markov models (AMMs), an approach that combines concepts from probability theory and information theory to consistently treat systematic force-field error and statistical errors in simulation and experiment. Our results demonstrate that AMMs can reconcile conflicting results for protein mechanisms obtained by different force fields and correct for a wide range of stationary and dynamical observables even when only equilibrium measurements are incorporated into the estimation process. This approach constitutes a unique avenue to combine experiment and computation into integrative models of biomolecular structure and dynamics.},

abstract = {Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a hormone with essential roles in regulating insulin secretion, carbohydrate metabolism and appetite. GLP-1 effects are mediated through binding to the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a class B G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that signals primarily through the stimulatory G protein Gs. Class B GPCRs are important therapeutic targets; however, our understanding of their mechanism of action is limited by the lack of structural information on activated and full-length receptors. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the peptide-activated GLP-1R-Gs complex at near atomic resolution. The peptide is clasped between the N-terminal domain and the transmembrane core of the receptor, and further stabilized by extracellular loops. Conformational changes in the transmembrane domain result in a sharp kink in the middle of transmembrane helix 6, which pivots its intracellular half outward to accommodate the $\alpha$5-helix of the Ras-like domain of Gs. These results provide a structural framework for understanding class B GPCR activation through hormone binding.},

While recent work from our group and others has demonstrated the utility of time-lagged co-variate models to study such systems, linearity assumptions can limit the compression of inherently nonlinear dynamics into just a few characteristic components. Recent work in the field of deep learning has led to the development of variational autoencoders (VAE), which are able to compress complex datasets into simpler manifolds. We present the use of a time-lagged VAE, or variational dynamics encoder (VDE), to reduce complex, nonlinear processes to a single embedding with high fidelity to the underlying dynamics. We demonstrate how the VDE is able to capture nontrivial dynamics in a variety of examples, including Brownian dynamics and atomistic protein folding. Additionally, we demonstrate a method for analyzing the VDE model, inspired by saliency mapping, to determine what features are selected by the VDE model to describe dynamics. The VDE presents an important step in applying techniques from deep learning to more accurately model and interpret complex biophysics.},

abstract = {The Wood-Ljungdahl pathway of anaerobic CO(2) fixation with hydrogen as reductant is considered a candidate for the first life-sustaining pathway on earth because it combines carbon dioxide fixation with the synthesis of ATP via a chemiosmotic mechanism. The acetogenic bacterium Acetobacterium woodii uses an ancient version of the pathway that has only one site to generate the electrochemical ion potential used to drive ATP synthesis, the ferredoxin-fueled, sodium-motive Rnf complex. However, hydrogen-based ferredoxin reduction is endergonic, and how the steep energy barrier is overcome has been an enigma for a long time. We have purified a multimeric [FeFe]-hydrogenase from A. woodii containing four subunits (HydABCD) which is predicted to have one [H]-cluster, three [2Fe2S]-, and six [4Fe4S]-clusters consistent with the experimental determination of 32 mol of Fe and 30 mol of acid-labile sulfur. The enzyme indeed catalyzed hydrogen-based ferredoxin reduction, but required NAD(+) for this reaction. NAD(+) was also reduced but only in the presence of ferredoxin. NAD(+) and ferredoxin reduction both required flavin. Spectroscopic analyses revealed that NAD(+) and ferredoxin reduction are strictly coupled and that they are reduced in a 1:1 stoichiometry. Apparently, the multimeric hydrogenase of A. woodii is a soluble energy-converting hydrogenase that uses electron bifurcation to drive the endergonic ferredoxin reduction by coupling it to the exergonic NAD(+) reduction.},

Characterization of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) is challenging, in part because of a lack of accurate physical models and the difficulty of interpreting experimental results. We have developed a general method to extract the dimensions and solvent quality (self-interactions) of IDPs from a single small-angle x-ray scattering measurement. We applied this procedure to a variety of IDPs and found that even IDPs with low net charge and high hydrophobicity remain highly expanded in water, contrary to the general expectation that protein-like sequences collapse in water. Our results suggest that the unfolded state of most foldable sequences is expanded; we conjecture that this property was selected by evolution to minimize misfolding and aggregation.},

abstract = {$\beta$-arrestins are critical regulator and transducer proteins for G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). $\beta$-arrestin is widely believed to be activated by forming a stable and stoichiometric GPCR-$\beta$-arrestin scaffold complex, which requires and is driven by the phosphorylated tail of the GPCR. Here we demonstrate a distinct and additional mechanism of $\beta$-arrestin activation that does not require stable GPCR-$\beta$-arrestin scaffolding or the GPCR tail. Instead, it occurs through transient engagement of the GPCR core, which destabilizes a conserved inter-domain charge network in $\beta$-arrestin. This promotes capture of $\beta$-arrestin at the plasma membrane and its accumulation in clathrin-coated endocytic structures (CCSs) after dissociation from the GPCR, requiring a series of interactions with membrane phosphoinositides and CCS-lattice proteins. $\beta$-arrestin clustering in CCSs in the absence of the upstream activating GPCR is associated with a $\beta$-arrestin-dependent component of the cellular ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) response. These results delineate a discrete mechanism of cellular $\beta$-arrestin function that is activated catalytically by GPCRs.},

It requires fewer trajectories than a single iteration of existing procedures, and it applies to both low and high friction dynamics. The new method screens a set of candidate collective variables for a good reaction coordinate that depends on a few relevant variables. The Bayesian information criterion determines whether additional variables significantly improve the reaction coordinate. Additionally, we present an advantageous transition path sampling algorithm and an algorithm to generate the most likely transition path in the space of collective variables. The method is demonstrated on two systems: a bistable model potential energy surface and nucleation in the Ising model. For the Ising model of nucleation, we quantify for the first time the role of nuclei surface area in the nucleation reaction coordinate. Surprisingly, increased surface area increases the stability of nuclei in two dimensions but decreases nuclei stability in three dimensions.},

abstract = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest family of receptors and major pharmacological targets. Whereas many GPCRs have been shown to form di-/oligomers, the size and stability of such complexes under physiological conditions are largely unknown. Here, we used direct receptor labeling with SNAP-tags and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to dynamically monitor single receptors on intact cells and thus compare the spatial arrangement, mobility, and supramolecular organization of three prototypical GPCRs: the $\beta$(1)-adrenergic receptor ($\beta$(1)AR), the $\beta$(2)-adrenergic receptor ($\beta$(2)AR), and the $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA(B)) receptor. These GPCRs showed very different degrees of di-/oligomerization, lowest for $\beta$(1)ARs (monomers/dimers) and highest for GABA(B) receptors (prevalently dimers/tetramers of heterodimers). The size of receptor complexes increased with receptor density as a result of transient receptor-receptor interactions. Whereas $\beta$(1)-/$\beta$(2)ARs were apparently freely diffusing on the cell surface, GABA(B) receptors were prevalently organized into ordered arrays, via interaction with the actin cytoskeleton. Agonist stimulation did not alter receptor di-/oligomerization, but increased the mobility of GABA(B) receptor complexes. These data provide a spatiotemporal characterization of $\beta$(1)-/$\beta$(2)ARs and GABA(B) receptors at single-molecule resolution. The results suggest that GPCRs are present on the cell surface in a dynamic equilibrium, with constant formation and dissociation of new receptor complexes that can be targeted, in a ligand-regulated manner, to different cell-surface microdomains.},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) modulate cytoplasmic signalling in response to extracellular stimuli, and are important therapeutic targets in a wide range of diseases. Structure determination of GPCRs in all activation states is important to elucidate the precise mechanism of signal transduction and to facilitate optimal drug design. However, due to their inherent instability, crystallisation of GPCRs in complex with cytoplasmic signalling proteins, such as heterotrimeric G proteins and $\beta$-arrestins, has proved challenging. Here, we describe the design of a minimal G protein, mini-Gs, which is composed solely of the GTPase domain from the adenylate cyclase stimulating G protein GsMini-Gsis a small, soluble protein, which efficiently couples GPCRs in the absence of G$\beta$$\gamma$ subunits. We engineered mini-Gs, using rational design mutagenesis, to form a stable complex with detergent-solubilised $\beta$1-adrenergic receptor ($\beta$1AR). Mini G proteins induce similar pharmacological and structural changes in GPCRs as heterotrimeric G proteins, but eliminate many of the problems associated with crystallisation of these complexes, specifically their large size, conformational dynamics and instability in detergent. They are therefore novel tools, which will facilitate the biochemical and structural characterisation of GPCRs in their active conformation.},

They might provide a valid alternative to classical binding sites in otherwise "undruggable" targets, but their hidden nature makes it difficult to use standard structure-based or computer-aided drug discovery approaches. Our group recently developed a Hamiltonian replica-exchange method (sampling water interfaces through scaled Hamiltonians or SWISH) that improves the sampling of hydrophobic cavities by scaling the interactions between water molecules and protein atoms. Here, we discuss further improvements to SWISH and its combination with fragment probe simulations. We tested the robustness and general applicability of the improved approach in a variety of pharmaceutically relevant targets. The chosen proteins: NPC2, p38$\alpha$, LfrR, and hPNMT, represent a set of diversified and interesting targets harboring nontrivial cryptic binding sites. In all cases, the updated version of our algorithm efficiently explored the cryptic sites.},

Here, we simulate CypA using multiple-microsecond-long atomistic molecular dynamics in explicit solvent and carry out NMR experiments. We analyze a large amount of time-dependent multidimensional data with a coarse-grained approach and map key dynamical features within individual macrostates by defining dynamics in terms of residue-residue contacts. The effects of substrate binding are observed to be largely sensed at a location over 15 {\AA} from the active site, implying its importance in allostery. Using NMR experiments, we confirm that a dynamic cluster of residues in this distal region is directly coupled to the active site. Furthermore, the dynamical network of interresidue contacts is found to be coupled and temporally dispersed, ranging over 4 to 5 orders of magnitude. Finally, using network centrality measures we demonstrate the changes in the communication network, connectivity, and influence of CypA residues upon substrate binding, mutation, and during catalysis. We identify key residues that potentially act as a bottleneck in the communication flow through the distinct regions in CypA and, therefore, as targets for future mutational studies. Mapping these dynamical features and the coupling of dynamics to function has crucial ramifications in understanding allosteric regulation in enzymes and proteins, in general.},

abstract = {The study of allostery has a central place in biology because of the myriad roles of allosteric proteins in cellular function. As technologies for probing the spatiotemporal resolution of biomolecules have become increasingly sophisticated, so has our understanding of the diverse structural and molecular mechanisms of allosteric proteins. Studies have shown that the allosteric signal is transmitted a through a network of residue-residue interactions connecting distal sites on a protein. Linking structural and dynamical changes to the functional role of individual residues will give a more complete molecular view of allostery. In this work, we highlight new mutational technologies that enable a systems-level, quantitative description of allostery that dissect the role of individual residues through large-scale functional screens. A molecular model for predicting allosteric hot spots can be developed by applying statistical tools on the resulting large sequence-structure-function data sets. Design of allosteric proteins with new function is essential for engineering biological systems. Previous design efforts demonstrate that the allosteric network is a powerful functional constraint in the design of novel or enhanced allosteric proteins. We discuss how a priori knowledge of an allosteric network could improve rational design by facilitating better navigation of the design space. Understanding the molecular "rules" governing allostery would elucidate the molecular basis of dysfunction in disease-associated allosteric proteins, provide a means for designing tailored therapeutics, and enable the design of new sensors and enzymes for synthetic biology.},

abstract = {Allostery in a protein involves effector binding at an allosteric site that changes the structure and/or dynamics at a distant, functional site. In addition to the chemical equilibrium of ligand binding, allostery involves a conformational equilibrium between one protein substate that binds the effector and a second substate that less strongly binds the effector. We run molecular dynamics simulations using simple, smooth energy landscapes to sample specific ligand-induced conformational transitions, as defined by the effector-bound and effector-unbound protein structures. These simulations can be performed using our web server (http://salilab.org/allosmod/). We then develop a set of features to analyze the simulations and capture the relevant thermodynamic properties of the allosteric conformational equilibrium. These features are based on molecular mechanics energy functions, stereochemical effects, and structural/dynamic coupling between sites. Using a machine-learning algorithm on a data set of 10 proteins and 179 mutations, we predict both the magnitude and the sign of the allosteric conformational equilibrium shift by the mutation; the impact of a large identifiable fraction of the mutations can be predicted with an average unsigned error of 1k(B)T. With similar accuracy, we predict the mutation effects for an 11th protein that was omitted from the initial training and testing of the machine-learning algorithm. We also assess which calculated thermodynamic properties contribute most to the accuracy of the prediction.},

abstract = {We have recently purified two proteins, alpha 39 and alpha 41, from bovine cerebral cortex which are substrates for ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin (Neer, E. J., Lok, J. M., and Wolf, L. G. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 14222-14229). Both proteins bind guanine nucleotides and interact with beta.gamma units. We have used limited proteolysis by trypsin to probe the structure and the conformational states of these proteins. The guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S)-liganded alpha 41 protein is cleaved into stable 39- and 24/25-kDa products which appear at the same rate. In addition, an 18-kDa peptide is seen. These products are also formed from GDP- or GTP-liganded alpha 41 but are less stable. Cleavage of alpha 39 is different. With GTP gamma S stable 37-kDa product predominates while with GTP or GDP the 37-kDa fragment appears transiently, followed by 24/25-kDa fragments which are stable in the presence of guanine nucleotides but rapidly cleaved without ligand. A 17-kDa peptide is also formed with GTP or GDP. The beta.gamma unit is cleaved by trypsin to stable peptides, a 26/27-kDa doublet and a 14-kDa peptide. Addition of beta.gamma slows tryptic cleavage of alpha 41 but not alpha 39. ADP-ribosylation of alpha 39 and alpha 41 by pertussis toxin affects their conformation in distinct ways which are clearly brought out by the GTP-liganded state. In contrast to unmodified alpha 41, ADP-ribosylated and GTP-liganded alpha 41 is proteolyzed very slowly and without formation of a 39-kDa intermediate. GTP gamma S seems to override the effect of ADP-ribosylation so that cleavage is more rapid and goes via the 39-kDa product. ADP-ribosylation affects alpha 39 more subtly. The GTP-liganded protein is first cleaved to the 37-kDa product and then degraded without forming the 24/25-kDa fragment. These results suggest that ADP-ribosylation might affect the conformation and function of these related proteins differently. The site of [32P]ADP-ribosylation is on the 18-kDa product of alpha 41 and on the 17-kDa product of alpha 39. We have raised polyclonal antibodies against alpha 39 and beta in rabbits and used the antibodies to examine antigenic sites on alpha 39 and beta. The antigenic determinants of alpha 39 are located over most of the native tryptic peptides. Tryptic cleavage of alpha 41 leads to rapid loss of cross-reactivity with anti-alpha 39 antibody.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Many chaperones promote nascent polypeptide folding followed by substrate release through ATP-dependent conformational changes. Here we show cryoEM structures of G$\alpha$ subunit folding intermediates in complex with full-length Ric-8A, a unique chaperone-client system in which substrate release is facilitated by guanine nucleotide binding to the client G protein. The structures of Ric-8A-G$\alpha$i and Ric-8A-G$\alpha$q complexes reveal that the chaperone employs its extended C-terminal region to cradle the Ras-like domain of G$\alpha$, positioning the Ras core in contact with the Ric-8A core while engaging its switch2 nucleotide binding region. The C-terminal $\alpha$5 helix of G$\alpha$ is held away from the Ras-like domain through Ric-8A core domain interactions, which critically depend on recognition of the G$\alpha$ C terminus by the chaperone. The structures, complemented with biochemical and cellular chaperoning data, support a folding quality control mechanism that ensures proper formation of the C-terminal $\alpha$5 helix before allowing GTP-gated release of G$\alpha$ from Ric-8A.},

The relative importance of the 2 pathways is determined not by comparing rate constants (a common misconception) but instead by comparing the flux through each pathway.

The second example is the mechanism of flavodoxin folding coupled to binding of its cofactor, flavin mononucleotide. In both cases, the mechanism switches from being dominated by the conformational selection pathway at low ligand concentration to induced fit at high ligand concentration. Over a wide range of conditions, a significant fraction of the flux occurs through both pathways.

abstract = {Accurate mechanistic description of structural changes in biomolecules is an increasingly important topic in structural and chemical biology. Markov models have emerged as a powerful way to approximate the molecular kinetics of large biomolecules while keeping full structural resolution in a divide-and-conquer fashion. However, the accuracy of these models is limited by that of the force fields used to generate the underlying molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. Whereas the quality of classical MD force fields has improved significantly in recent years, remaining errors in the Boltzmann weights are still on the order of a few [Formula: see text], which may lead to significant discrepancies when comparing to experimentally measured rates or state populations. Here we take the view that simulations using a sufficiently good force-field sample conformations that are valid but have inaccurate weights, yet these weights may be made accurate by incorporating experimental data a posteriori. To do so, we propose augmented Markov models (AMMs), an approach that combines concepts from probability theory and information theory to consistently treat systematic force-field error and statistical errors in simulation and experiment. Our results demonstrate that AMMs can reconcile conflicting results for protein mechanisms obtained by different force fields and correct for a wide range of stationary and dynamical observables even when only equilibrium measurements are incorporated into the estimation process. This approach constitutes a unique avenue to combine experiment and computation into integrative models of biomolecular structure and dynamics.},

An analogous reaction is catalyzed by benzoyl-coenzyme A reductases (BCRs) that have a key role in the globally important bacterial degradation of aromatic compounds at anoxic sites. Because of the lack of structural information, the catalytic mechanism of enzymatic benzene ring reduction remained obscure. Here, we present the structural characterization of a dearomatizing BCR containing an unprecedented tungsten cofactor that transfers electrons to the benzene ring in an aprotic cavity. Substrate binding induces proton transfer from the bulk solvent to the active site by expelling a Zn(2+) that is crucial for active site encapsulation. Our results shed light on the structural basis of an electron transfer process at the negative redox potential limit in biology.

abstract = {The ability of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to initiate complex cascades of cellular signaling is governed by the sequential coupling of three main transducer proteins, G protein, GPCR kinase (GRK), and $\beta$-arrestin. Mounting evidence indicates these transducers all have distinct conformational preferences and binding modes. However, interrogating each transducer's mechanism of interaction with GPCRs has been complicated by the interplay of transducer-mediated signaling events. For example, GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation recruits and induces conformational changes in $\beta$-arrestin, which facilitates coupling to the GPCR transmembrane core. Here we compare the allosteric interactions of G proteins and $\beta$-arrestins with GPCRs' transmembrane cores by using the enzyme sortase to ligate a synthetic phosphorylated peptide onto the carboxyl terminus of three different receptors. Phosphopeptide ligation onto the $\beta$2-adrenergic receptor ($\beta$2AR) allows stabilization of a high-affinity receptor active state by $\beta$-arrestin1, permitting us to define elements in the $\beta$2AR and $\beta$-arrestin1 that contribute to the receptor transmembrane core interaction. Interestingly, ligation of the identical phosphopeptide onto the $\beta$2AR, the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 2 and the $\mu$-opioid receptor reveals that the ability of $\beta$-arrestin1 to enhance agonist binding relative to G protein differs substantially among receptors. Furthermore, strong allosteric coupling of $\beta$-arrestin1 correlates with its ability to attenuate, or "desensitize," G protein activation in vitro. Sortase ligation thus provides a versatile method to introduce complex, defined phosphorylation patterns into GPCRs, and analogous strategies could be applied to other classes of posttranslationally modified proteins. These homogeneously phosphorylated GPCRs provide an innovative means to systematically study receptor-transducer interactions.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins reveal the existence of many transient surface pockets; however, the factors determining what small subset of these represent druggable or functionally relevant ligand binding sites, called "cryptic sites," are not understood. Here, we examine multiple X-ray structures for a set of proteins with validated cryptic sites, using the computational hot spot identification tool FTMap. The results show that cryptic sites in ligand-free structures generally have a strong binding energy hot spot very close by. As expected, regions around cryptic sites exhibit above-average flexibility, and close to 50% of the proteins studied here have unbound structures that could accommodate the ligand without clashes. Nevertheless, the strong hot spot neighboring each cryptic site is almost always exploited by the bound ligand, suggesting that binding may frequently involve an induced fit component. We additionally evaluated the structural basis for cryptic site formation, by comparing unbound to bound structures. Cryptic sites are most frequently occluded in the unbound structure by intrusion of loops (22.5%), side chains (19.4%), or in some cases entire helices (5.4%), but motions that create sites that are too open can also eliminate pockets (19.4%). The flexibility of cryptic sites frequently leads to missing side chains or loops (12%) that are particularly evident in low resolution crystal structures. An interesting observation is that cryptic sites formed solely by the movement of side chains, or of backbone segments with fewer than five residues, result only in low affinity binding sites with limited use for drug discovery.},

Drug development efforts have targeted both receptors for the treatment of insomnia, circadian rhythm and mood disorders, and cancer3, and MT2 has also been implicated in type 2 diabetes4,5. Here we report X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) structures of the human MT2 receptor in complex with the agonists 2-phenylmelatonin (2-PMT) and ramelteon6 at resolutions of 2.8~{\AA} and 3.3~{\AA}, respectively, along with two structures of function-related mutants: H2085.46A (superscripts represent the Ballesteros-Weinstein residue numbering nomenclature7) and N862.50D, obtained in complex with 2-PMT. Comparison of the structures of MT2 with a published structure8 of MT1 reveals that, despite conservation of the orthosteric ligand-binding site residues, there are notable conformational variations as well as differences in [3H]melatonin dissociation kinetics that provide insights into the selectivity between melatonin receptor subtypes. A membrane-buried lateral ligand entry channel is observed in both MT1 and MT2, but in addition the MT2 structures reveal a narrow opening towards the solvent in the extracellular part of the receptor. We provide functional and kinetic data that support a prominent role for intramembrane ligand entry in both receptors, and suggest that there might also be an extracellular entry path in MT2. Our findings contribute to a molecular understanding of melatonin receptor subtype selectivity and ligand access modes, which are essential for the design of highly selective melatonin tool compounds and therapeutic agents.},

abstract = {A key factor influencing a drug's efficacy is its residence time in the binding pocket of the host protein. Using atomistic computer simulation to predict this residence time and the associated dissociation process is a desirable but extremely difficult task due to the long timescales involved. This gets further complicated by the presence of biophysical factors such as steric and solvation effects. In this work, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the unbinding of a popular prototypical hydrophobic cavity-ligand system using a metadynamics-based approach that allows direct assessment of kinetic pathways and parameters. When constrained to move in an axial manner, the unbinding time is found to be on the order of 4,000 s. In accordance with previous studies, we find that the cavity must pass through a region of sharp wetting transition manifested by sudden and high fluctuations in solvent density. When we remove the steric constraints on ligand, the unbinding happens predominantly by an alternate pathway, where the unbinding becomes 20 times faster, and the sharp wetting transition instead becomes continuous. We validate the unbinding timescales from metadynamics through a Poisson analysis, and by comparison through detailed balance to binding timescale estimates from unbiased MD. This work demonstrates that enhanced sampling can be used to perform explicit solvent MD studies at timescales previously unattainable, to our knowledge, obtaining direct and reliable pictures of the underlying physiochemical factors including free energies and rate constants. },

abstract = {The reversible association of alpha and beta gamma subunits of GTP-binding proteins is important for signal transmission from a variety of cell-surface receptors to intracellular effectors. Previous work showed that 1,6-bis(maleimido)hexane, which crosslinks cysteine residues, crosslinks alpha o and alpha i-1 to beta gamma. These crosslinks are likely to form through a conserved cysteine because 1,6-bis(maleimido)hexane can also crosslink alpha i-2, alpha 1, alpha s and Drosophila alpha 1 to give products of the same apparent molecular weight as crosslinked alpha o beta gamma and alpha i-1 beta gamma. These proteins have only two cysteines in common. Therefore, we mutated each of the two conserved cysteines of alpha o to alanines. Mutation of Cys215 prevents crosslinking to beta gamma, but does not affect binding of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate or the ability of the mutated alpha subunit to bind beta gamma. In models of the alpha subunit based on the crystal structure of p21ras, Cys215 is located on the face opposite to the GTP-binding site and near an area that changes conformation depending on the nucleotide bound. This surface on the alpha subunit overlaps a putative effector binding region, raising important questions about the spatial organization of the proteins as they form ternary complexes. Mutation of Cys325 has no effect on crosslinking but, surprisingly, decreases by a factor of 10 the affinity of the mutated protein for GDP, relative to wild type, without changing the affinity for guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate. This mutation falls within a region thought to contact receptors and may represent a site through which receptors enhance the release of GDP.},

abstract = {Protein-protein interactions are implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases and are therefore attractive but challenging targets for drug design. One of the challenges in development is the identification of potential druggable binding sites in protein interacting interfaces. Identification of interface surfaces can greatly aid rational drug design of small molecules inhibiting protein-protein interactions. In this work, starting from the structure of a free monomer, we have developed a ligand docking based method, called "FindBindSite" (FBS), to locate protein-protein interacting interface regions and potential druggable sites in this interface. FindBindSite utilizes the results from docking a small and diverse library of small molecules to the entire protein structure. By clustering regions with the highest docked ligand density from FBS, we have shown that these high ligand density regions strongly correlate with the known protein-protein interacting surfaces. We have further predicted potential druggable binding sites on the protein surface using FBS, with druggability being defined as the site with high density of ligands docked. FBS shows a hit rate of 71% with high confidence and 93% with lower confidence for the 41 proteins used for predicting druggable binding sites on the protein-protein interface. Mining the regions of lower ligand density that are contiguous with the high scoring high ligand density regions from FBS, we were able to map 70% of the protein-protein interacting surface in 24 out of 41 structures tested. We also observed that FBS has limited sensitivity to the size and nature of the small molecule library used for docking. The experimentally determined hotspot residues for each protein-protein complex cluster near the best scoring druggable binding sites identified by FBS. These results validate the ability of our technique to identify druggable sites within protein-protein interface regions that have the maximal possibility of interface disruption.},

abstract = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest family of membrane proteins in the human genome and mediate cellular responses to an extensive array of hormones, neurotransmitters and sensory stimuli. Although some crystal structures have been determined for GPCRs, most are for modified forms, showing little basal activity, and are bound to inverse agonists or antagonists. Consequently, these structures correspond to receptors in their inactive states. The visual pigment rhodopsin is the only GPCR for which structures exist that are thought to be in the active state. However, these structures are for the apoprotein, or opsin, form that does not contain the agonist all-trans retinal. Here we present a crystal structure at a resolution of 3 {\AA} for the constitutively active rhodopsin mutant Glu 113 Gln in complex with a peptide derived from the carboxy terminus of the $\alpha$-subunit of the G protein transducin. The protein is in an active conformation that retains retinal in the binding pocket after photoactivation. Comparison with the structure of ground-state rhodopsin suggests how translocation of the retinal $\beta$-ionone ring leads to a rotation of transmembrane helix 6, which is the critical conformational change on activation. A key feature of this conformational change is a reorganization of water-mediated hydrogen-bond networks between the retinal-binding pocket and three of the most conserved GPCR sequence motifs. We thus show how an agonist ligand can activate its GPCR.},

Here we present a structure of the $\beta$2AR in complex with the carboxyl terminal 14 amino acids from G$\alpha$s along with the structure of the GDP-bound Gs heterotrimer. These structures provide evidence for an alternate interaction between the $\beta$2AR and Gs that may represent an intermediate that contributes to Gs coupling specificity.},

GTP hydrolysis<br />in the active center of Ras acts as a prototype for<br />many GTPases and is the key to the understanding<br />of several diseases, including cancer. Therefore,<br />Ras has been the focus of intense research over the<br />last decades. A recent neutron diffraction crystal<br />structure of Ras indicated a protonated $\gamma$-guanylyl<br />imidodiphosphate ($\gamma$-GppNHp) group, which has<br />put the protonation state of GTP in question.

To<br />determine the detailed pre-hydrolysis state of Ras,<br />we calculated infrared and NMR spectra from<br />quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics<br />(QM/MM) simulations and compared them with<br />those from previous studies. Furthermore, we<br />measured infrared spectra of GTP and several GTP<br />analogs bound to lipidated Ras on a membrane<br />system under near-native conditions.

abstract = {Conformational equilibria of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are intimately involved in intracellular signaling. Here conformational substates of the GPCR rhodopsin are investigated in micelles of dodecyl maltoside (DDM) and in phospholipid nanodiscs by monitoring the spatial positions of transmembrane helices 6 and 7 at the cytoplasmic surface using site-directed spin labeling and double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy. The photoactivated receptor in DDM is dominated by one conformation with weak pH dependence. In nanodiscs, however, an ensemble of pH-dependent conformational substates is observed, even at pH 6.0 where the MIIbH(+) form defined by proton uptake and optical spectroscopic methods is reported to be the sole species present in native disk membranes. In nanodiscs, the ensemble of substates in the photoactivated receptor spontaneously decays to that characteristic of the inactive state with a lifetime of ∼16 min at 20 {\textdegree}C. Importantly, transducin binding to the activated receptor selects a subset of the ensemble in which multiple substates are apparently retained. The results indicate that in a native-like lipid environment rhodopsin activation is not analogous to a simple binary switch between two defined conformations, but the activated receptor is in equilibrium between multiple conformers that in principle could recognize different binding partners.},

abstract = {The mechanism by which the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is activated upon dimerization has eluded definition. We find that the EGFR kinase domain can be activated by increasing its local concentration or by mutating a leucine (L834R) in the activation loop, the phosphorylation of which is not required for activation. This suggests that the kinase domain is intrinsically autoinhibited, and an intermolecular interaction promotes its activation. Using further mutational analysis and crystallography we demonstrate that the autoinhibited conformation of the EGFR kinase domain resembles that of Src and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). EGFR activation results from the formation of an asymmetric dimer in which the C-terminal lobe of one kinase domain plays a role analogous to that of cyclin in activated CDK/cyclin complexes. The CDK/cyclin-like complex formed by two kinase domains thus explains the activation of EGFR-family receptors by homo- or heterodimerization.},

Motivated by modern correlation microscopy approaches, the receptor correlation functions in physical models based on diffusion-influenced reaction is studied. Using analytical and stochastic modeling, this paper focuses on the hybrid regime where diffusion and reaction are not truly separable. The time receptor autocorrelation functions are shown to be indexed by different time scales and their asymptotic expansions are given. Stochastic simulations show that this analysis can be extended to situations with a small number of molecules. It is also demonstrated that this analysis applies when receptor immobilization is coupled to environmental noise.},

abstract = {Two strategies have been recently employed to push molecular simulation to long, biologically relevant time scales: projection-based analysis of results from specialized hardware producing a small number of ultralong trajectories and the statistical interpretation of massive parallel sampling performed with Markov state models (MSMs). Here, we assess the MSM as an analysis method by constructing a Markov model from ultralong trajectories, specifically two previously reported 100 $\mu$s trajectories of the FiP35 WW domain (Shaw, D. E. Science 2010, 330, 341-346). We find that the MSM approach yields novel insights. It discovers new statistically significant folding pathways, in which either beta-hairpin of the WW domain can form first. The rates of this process approach experimental values in a direct quantitative comparison (time scales of 5.0 $\mu$s and 100 ns), within a factor of ∼2. Finally, the hub-like topology of the MSM and identification of a holo conformation predicts how WW domains may function through a conformational selection mechanism.},

Changes in the hydrogen bonding network in this microswitch suggest a possible mechanism for modified G-protein signaling and enhanced thermal stability. These structures, signaling data, and thermal stability analysis with a panel of pharmacological ligands provide a basis for understanding the role of the sodium-coordinating residues on stability and G-protein signaling.

This study demonstrates the ease of scaling Transition Path Sampling for applications on many degree of freedom systems, whose energy surface is a complex terrain of valleys and saddle points. As a Monte Carlo importance sampling method, transition path sampling is capable of surmounting barriers in path phase space and focuses simulation on the rare event of enzyme catalyzed atom transfers. Generation of the transition path ensemble, for this reaction, resolves a paradox in the literature in which some studies exposed the catalytic mechanism of hydride and proton transfer by lactate dehydrogenase to be concerted and others stepwise. Transition path sampling has confirmed both mechanisms as possible paths from reactants to products. With the objective to identify a generalized, reduced reaction coordinate, time series of both donor-acceptor distances and residue distances from the active site have been examined. During the transition from pyruvate to lactate, residues located behind the transferring hydride collectively compress toward the active site causing residues located behind the hydride acceptor to relax away. It is demonstrated that an incomplete compression/relaxation transition across the donor-acceptor axis compromises the reaction.},

abstract = {Upon activation by the Gq family of G$\alpha$ subunits, G$\beta$$\gamma$ subunits, and some Rho family GTPases, phospholipase C-$\beta$ (PLC-$\beta$) isoforms hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. PLC-$\beta$ isoforms also function as GTPase-activating proteins, potentiating Gq deactivation. To elucidate the mechanism of this mutual regulation, we measured the thermodynamics and kinetics of PLC-$\beta$3 binding to G$\alpha$q FRET and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, two physically distinct methods, both yielded Kd values of about 200 nm for PLC-$\beta$3-G$\alpha$q binding. This Kd is 50-100 times greater than the EC50 for G$\alpha$q-mediated PLC-$\beta$3 activation and for the G$\alpha$q GTPase-activating protein activity of PLC-$\beta$. The measured Kd was not altered either by the presence of phospholipid vesicles, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and Ca(2+), or by the identity of the fluorescent labels. FRET-based kinetic measurements were also consistent with a Kd of 200 nm We determined that PLC-$\beta$3 hysteresis, whereby PLC-$\beta$3 remains active for some time following either G$\alpha$q-PLC-$\beta$3 dissociation or PLC-$\beta$3-potentiated G$\alpha$q deactivation, is not sufficient to explain the observed discrepancy between EC50 and Kd These results indicate that the mechanism by which G$\alpha$q and PLC-$\beta$3 mutually regulate each other is far more complex than a simple, two-state allosteric model and instead is probably kinetically determined.},

The analysis suggests the existence of change points as well as periods of persistent community structure; these are not well estimated by standard methods due to the small sample size of any one developmental period or region of the brain. Community detection is challenging when the network structure is estimated with uncertainty. Dynamic networks present additional challenges but also add information across time periods. We propose a global community detection method, persistent communities by eigenvector smoothing (PisCES), that combines information across a series of networks, longitudinally, to strengthen the inference for each period. Our method is derived from evolutionary spectral clustering and degree correction methods. Data-driven solutions to the problem of tuning parameter selection are provided. In simulations we find that PisCES performs better than competing methods designed for a low signal-to-noise ratio. Recently obtained gene expression data from rhesus monkey brains provide samples from finely partitioned brain regions over a broad time span including pre- and postnatal periods. Of interest is how gene communities develop over space and time; however, once the data are divided into homogeneous spatial and temporal periods, sample sizes are very small, making inference quite challenging. Applying PisCES to medial prefrontal cortex in monkey rhesus brains from near conception to adulthood reveals dense communities that persist, merge, and diverge over time and others that are loosely organized and short lived, illustrating how dynamic community detection can yield interesting insights into processes such as brain development.},

abstract = {G protein alpha subunits consist of two domains, a GTPase domain and a helical domain. Receptors activate G proteins by catalyzing replacement of GDP, which is buried between these two domains, with GTP. Substitution of the homologous alphai2 residues for four alphas residues in switch III, a region that changes conformation upon GTP binding, or of one nearby helical domain residue decreases the ability of alphas to be activated by the beta-adrenergic receptor and by aluminum fluoride. Both sets of mutations increase the affinity of alphas for the beta-adrenergic receptor, based on an increased amount of high affinity binding of the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol. The mutations also decrease the rate of receptor-mediated activation and disrupt the ability of the beta-adrenergic receptor to increase the apparent affinity of alphas for the GTP analog, guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). Simultaneous replacement of the helical domain residue and one of the four switch III residues with the homologous alphai2 residues restores normal receptor-mediated activation, suggesting that the defects caused by mutations at the domain interface are due to altered interdomain interactions. These results suggest that interactions between residues across the domain interface are involved in two key steps of receptor-mediated activation, promotion of GTP binding and subsequent receptor-G protein dissociation.},

abstract = {Protein-ATP interactions are ubiquitous in a wide variety of biological processes. Correctly locating ATP-binding sites from protein information is an important but challenging task for protein function annotation and drug discovery. However, there is no method that can optimally identify ATP-binding sites for different proteins. In this study, we report a new composite predictor, ATPbind, for ATP-binding sites by integrating the outputs of two template-based predictors (i.e., S-SITE and TM-SITE) and three discriminative sequence-driven features of proteins: position specific scoring matrix, predicted secondary structure, and predicted solvent accessibility. In ATPbind, we assembled multiple support vector machines (SVMs) based on a random under-sampling technique to cope with the serious imbalance phenomenon between the numbers of ATP-binding sites and of non-ATP-binding sites. We also constructed a new gold-standard benchmark dataset consisting of 429 ATP-binding proteins from the PDB database to evaluate and compare the proposed ATPbind with other existing predictors. Starting from a query sequence and predicted I-TASSER models, ATPbind can achieve an average accuracy of 72%, covering 62% of all ATP binding sites while achieving a Matthews Correlation Coefficient value that is significantly higher than that of other state-of-the-art predictors.},

abstract = {The active-state complex between an agonist-bound receptor and a guanine nucleotide-free G protein represents the fundamental signaling assembly for the majority of hormone and neurotransmitter signaling. We applied single-particle electron microscopy (EM) analysis to examine the architecture of agonist-occupied $\beta$(2)-adrenoceptor ($\beta$(2)AR) in complex with the heterotrimeric G protein Gs (G$\alpha$s$\beta$$\gamma$). EM 2D averages and 3D reconstructions of the detergent-solubilized complex reveal an overall architecture that is in very good agreement with the crystal structure of the active-state ternary complex. Strikingly however, the $\alpha$-helical domain of G$\alpha$s appears highly flexible in the absence of nucleotide. In contrast, the presence of the pyrophosphate mimic foscarnet (phosphonoformate), and also the presence of GDP, favor the stabilization of the $\alpha$-helical domain on the Ras-like domain of G$\alpha$s. Molecular modeling of the $\alpha$-helical domain in the 3D EM maps suggests that in its stabilized form it assumes a conformation reminiscent to the one observed in the crystal structure of G$\alpha$s-GTP$\gamma$S. These data argue that the $\alpha$-helical domain undergoes a nucleotide-dependent transition from a flexible to a conformationally stabilized state.},

We established conditions in the mass spectrometer that preserve noncovalent ligand binding to the human purinergic receptor P2Y1. Results established differing affinities for nucleotides and the drug MRS2500 and link antagonist binding with the absence of receptor phosphorylation. Overall, therefore, our results are consistent with drug binding, preventing the conformational changes that facilitate downstream signaling. More generally, we highlight opportunities for mass spectrometry to probe effects of ligand binding on G protein-coupled receptors.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations contain considerable information with regard to the motions and fluctuations of a protein, the magnitude of which can be used to estimate conformational entropy. Here we survey conformational entropy across protein fold space using the Dynameomics database, which represents the largest existing data set of protein MD simulations for representatives of essentially all known protein folds. We provide an overview of MD-derived entropies accounting for all possible degrees of dihedral freedom on an unprecedented scale. Although different side chains might be expected to impose varying restrictions on the conformational space that the backbone can sample, we found that the backbone entropy and side chain size are not strictly coupled. An outcome of these analyses is the Dynameomics Entropy Dictionary, the contents of which have been compared with entropies derived by other theoretical approaches and experiment. As might be expected, the conformational entropies scale linearly with the number of residues, demonstrating that conformational entropy is an extensive property of proteins. The calculated conformational entropies of folding agree well with previous estimates. Detailed analysis of specific cases identifies deviations in conformational entropy from the average values that highlight how conformational entropy varies with sequence, secondary structure, and tertiary fold. Notably, $\alpha$-helices have lower entropy on average than do $\beta$-sheets, and both are lower than coil regions.},

We search for "themes"-segments of at least 35 residues of similar sequence and structure-reused within representative sets of 15,016 domains [Evolutionary Classification of Protein Domains (ECOD) database] or 20,398 chains [Protein Data Bank (PDB)]. We observe that theme reuse is highly prevalent and that reuse is more extensive when the length threshold for identifying a theme is lower. Structural domains, the best characterized form of reuse in proteins, are just one of many complex and intertwined evolutionary traces. Others include long themes shared among a few proteins, which encompass and overlap with shorter themes that recur in numerous proteins. The observed complexity is consistent with evolution by duplication and divergence, and some of the themes might include descendants of ancestral segments. The observed recursive footprints, where the same amino acid can simultaneously participate in several intertwined themes, could be a useful concept for protein design.

abstract = {Almost all the natural or human made systems can be understood and controlled using complex networks. This is a difficult problem due to the very large number of elements in such networks, on the order of billions and higher, which makes it impossible to use conventional network analysis methods. Herein, we employ artificial intelligence (specifically swarm computing), to compute centrality metrics in a completely decentralized fashion. More exactly, we show that by overlaying a homogeneous artificial system (inspired by swarm intelligence) over a complex network (which is a heterogeneous system), and playing a game in the fused system, the changes in the homogeneous system will reflect perfectly the complex network properties. Our method, dubbed Game of Thieves (GOT), computes the importance of all network elements (both nodes and edges) in polylogarithmic time with respect to the total number of nodes. Contrary, the state-of-the-art methods need at least a quadratic time. Moreover, the excellent capabilities of our proposed approach, it terms of speed, accuracy, and functionality, open the path for better ways of understanding and controlling complex networks.},

abstract = {Heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) transmit extracellular stimuli perceived by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to intracellular signaling cascades. Hundreds of GPCRs exist in humans and are the targets of a large percentage of the pharmaceutical drugs used today. Because G proteins are regulated by GPCRs, small molecules that directly modulate G proteins have the potential to become therapeutic agents. However, strategies to develop modulators have been hampered by a lack of structural knowledge of targeting sites for specific modulator binding. Here we present the mechanism of action of the cyclic depsipeptide YM-254890, which is a recently discovered Gq-selective inhibitor. YM-254890 specifically inhibits the GDP/GTP exchange reaction of alpha subunit of Gq protein (Galphaq) by inhibiting the GDP release from Galphaq. X-ray crystal structure analysis of the Galphaqbetagamma-YM-254890 complex shows that YM-254890 binds the hydrophobic cleft between two interdomain linkers connecting the GTPase and helical domains of the Galphaq. The binding stabilizes an inactive GDP-bound form through direct interactions with switch I and impairs the linker flexibility. Our studies provide a novel targeting site for the development of small molecules that selectively inhibit each Galpha subunit and an insight into the molecular mechanism of G protein activation.},

As a result, understanding the molecular basis for their activity is of paramount importance. Recent technological advances have made GPCR structural biology increasingly tractable, offering views of these receptors in unprecedented atomic detail. Structural and biophysical data have shown that GPCRs function as complex allosteric machines, communicating ligand-binding events through conformational change. Changes in receptor conformation lead to activation of effector proteins, such as G proteins and arrestins, which are themselves conformational switches. Here, we review how structural biology has illuminated the agonist-induced cascade of conformational changes that culminate in a cellular response to GPCR activation.

The performance of AllositePro is superior to that of the other currently available methods. Using AllositePro, we predicted a novel allosteric site in cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and validated it by site-directed mutagenesis assay.

abstract = {The structural and mechanical properties of monomeric actin (G-actin), the trimer nucleus, and actin filaments (F-actins) are determined as a function of the conformation of the DNase I-binding loop (DB loop) by using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and coarse-grained (CG) analysis. Recent x-ray structures of ADP-bound G-actin (G-ADP) by Otterbein et al. [Otterbein, L. R., Graceffa, P. {\&} Dominguez, R. (2001) Science 293, 708-711] and ATP-bound G-actin (G-ATP) by Graceffa and Dominguez [Graceffa, P. {\&} Dominguez, R. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 34172-34180] indicate that the DB loop of actin does not have a well defined secondary structure in the ATP state but folds into an alpha-helix in the ADP state. MD simulations and CG analysis indicate that such a helical DB loop significantly weakens the intermonomer interactions of actin assemblies and thus leads to a wider, shorter, and more disordered filament. The computed persistence lengths of F-actin composed of G-ATP (16 microm) and of G-ADP (8.5 microm) agree well with the experimental values for the two states. Therefore, the loop-to-helix transition of the DB loop may be one of the factors that lead to the changes in structural and mechanical properties of F-actin after ATP hydrolysis. This result may provide a direct connection between the conformational changes of an actin monomer and the structural and mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton. The information provided by MD simulations also helps to understand the possible origin of the special features of actin dynamics.},

abstract = {Box jellyfish and vertebrates are separated by >500 million years of evolution yet have structurally analogous lens eyes that employ rhodopsin photopigments for vision. All opsins possess a negatively charged residue-the counterion-to maintain visible-light sensitivity and facilitate photoisomerization of their retinaldehyde chromophore. In vertebrate rhodopsins, the molecular evolution of the counterion position-from a highly conserved distal location in the second extracellular loop (E181) to a proximal location in the third transmembrane helix (E113)-is established as a key driver of higher fidelity photoreception. Here, we use computational biology and heterologous action spectroscopy to determine whether the appearance of the advanced visual apparatus in box jellyfish was also accompanied by changes in the opsin tertiary structure. We found that the counterion in an opsin from the lens eye of the box jellyfish Carybdea rastonii (JellyOp) has also moved to a unique proximal location within the transmembrane bundle-E94 in TM2. Furthermore, we reveal that this Schiff base/counterion system includes an additional positive charge-R186-that has coevolved with E94 to functionally separate E94 and E181 in the chromophore-binding pocket of JellyOp. By engineering this pocket-neutralizing R186 and E94, or swapping E94 with the vertebrate counterion E113-we can recreate versions of the invertebrate and vertebrate counterion systems, respectively, supporting a relatively similar overall architecture in this region of animal opsins. In summary, our data establish the third only counterion site in animal opsins and reveal convergent evolution of tertiary structure in opsins from distantly related species with advanced visual systems.},

abstract = {Selective coupling of G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein)-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to specific G$\alpha$-protein subtypes is critical to transform extracellular signals, carried by natural ligands and clinical drugs, into cellular responses. At the center of this transduction event lies the formation of a signaling complex between the receptor and G protein. We report the crystal structure of light-sensitive GPCR rhodopsin bound to an engineered mini-Go protein. The conformation of the receptor is identical to all previous structures of active rhodopsin, including the complex with arrestin. Thus, rhodopsin seems to adopt predominantly one thermodynamically stable active conformation, effectively acting like a "structural switch," allowing for maximum efficiency in the visual system. Furthermore, our analysis of the well-defined GPCR-G protein interface suggests that the precise position of the carboxyl-terminal "hook-like" element of the G protein (its four last residues) relative to the TM7/helix 8 (H8) joint of the receptor is a significant determinant in selective G protein activation.},

As a liquid is cooled far below its melting point, dynamics in some regions of the sample can be orders of magnitude faster than dynamics in other regions only a few nanometers away. In this review, the experimental work that characterizes this heterogeneity is described. In particular, the following questions are addressed: How large are the heterogeneities? How long do they last? How much do dynamics vary between the fastest and slowest regions? Why do these heterogeneities arise? The answers to these questions influence practical applications of glass-forming materials, including polymers, metallic glasses, and pharmaceuticals.},

We sequentially address early studies that motivated the method, canonical papers that established the use of MSMs for MD analysis, and subsequent advances in software and analysis protocols. The derivation of a variational principle for MSMs in 2013 signified a turning point from expertise-driving MSM building to a systematic, objective protocol. The variational approach, combined with best practices for model selection and open-source software, enabled a wide range of MSM analysis for applications such as protein folding and allostery, ligand binding, and protein-protein association. To conclude, the current frontiers of methods development are highlighted, as well as exciting applications in experimental design and drug discovery.},

Despite considerable progress, the molecular basis of subtype-specific ligand selectivity, especially for peptide receptors, remains unknown. Here, by integrating DNP-enhanced solid-state NMR spectroscopy with advanced molecular modeling and docking, the mechanism of the subtype selectivity of human bradykinin receptors for their peptide agonists has been resolved. The conserved middle segments of the bound peptides show distinct conformations that result in different presentations of their N and C termini toward their receptors. Analysis of the peptide-receptor interfaces reveals that the charged N-terminal residues of the peptides are mainly selected through electrostatic interactions, whereas the C-terminal segments are recognized via both conformations and interactions. The detailed molecular picture obtained by this approach opens a new gateway for exploring the complex conformational and chemical space of peptides and peptide analogs for designing GPCR subtype-selective biochemical tools and drugs.},

abstract = {We consider the differences between the many-pathway protein folding model derived from theoretical energy landscape considerations and the defined-pathway model derived from experiment. A basic tenet of the energy landscape model is that proteins fold through many heterogeneous pathways by way of amino acid-level dynamics biased toward selecting native-like interactions. The many pathways imagined in the model are not observed in the structure-formation stage of folding by experiments that would have found them, but they have now been detected and characterized for one protein in the initial prenucleation stage. Analysis presented here shows that these many microscopic trajectories are not distinct in any functionally significant way, and they have neither the structural information nor the biased energetics needed to select native vs. nonnative interactions during folding. The opposed defined-pathway model stems from experimental results that show that proteins are assemblies of small cooperative units called foldons and that a number of proteins fold in a reproducible pathway one foldon unit at a time. Thus, the same foldon interactions that encode the native structure of any given protein also naturally encode its particular foldon-based folding pathway, and they collectively sum to produce the energy bias toward native interactions that is necessary for efficient folding. Available information suggests that quantized native structure and stepwise folding coevolved in ancient repeat proteins and were retained as a functional pair due to their utility for solving the difficult protein folding problem.},

MSM reduce the high dimensionality inherent to MD simulations as they partition the free energy landscape into discrete states, generating a kinetic model as a series of uncorrelated jumps between states. Here, we detail a new method, called GRadient Adaptive Decomposition, which optimizes coarse-grained MSM by refining borders with respect to the gradient along the free energy surface. The proposed method requires only a small number of initial microstates because it corrects for errors produced by limited sampling. Whereas many methods rely on fuzzy partitions for proper statistics, GRAD retains a crisp decomposition. Two test studies are presented to illustrate the method and assess its accuracy: the first analyzes MSM of idealized model potentials, while the second is a study of the dynamics of unstacking of the deoxyribose adenosine monophosphate dinucleotide.},

The crucial step in their degradation is overcoming the resonance energy that stabilizes the ring structure. The classical strategy for degradation comprises an attack by oxygenases that hydroxylate and finally cleave the ring with the help of activated molecular oxygen. Here, we describe three alternative strategies used by microorganisms to degrade aromatic compounds. All three of these methods involve the use of CoA thioesters and ring cleavage by hydrolysis. However, these strategies are based on different ring activation mechanisms that consist of either formation of a non-aromatic ring-epoxide under oxic conditions, or reduction of the aromatic ring under anoxic conditions using one of two completely different systems.},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors are a large family of membrane proteins activated by a variety of structurally diverse ligands making them highly adaptable signaling molecules. Despite recent advances in the structural biology of this protein family, the mechanism by which ligands induce allosteric changes in protein structure and dynamics for its signaling function remains a mystery. Here, we propose the use of terahertz spectroscopy combined with molecular dynamics simulation and protein evolutionary network modeling to address the mechanism of activation by directly probing the concerted fluctuations of retinal ligand and transmembrane helices in rhodopsin. This approach allows us to examine the role of conformational heterogeneity in the selection and stabilization of specific signaling pathways in the photo-activation of the receptor. We demonstrate that ligand-induced shifts in the conformational equilibrium prompt vibrational resonances in the protein structure that link the dynamics of conserved interactions with fluctuations of the active-state ligand. The connection of vibrational modes creates an allosteric association of coupled fluctuations that forms a coherent signaling pathway from the receptor ligand-binding pocket to the G-protein activation region. Our evolutionary analysis of rhodopsin-like GPCRs suggest that specific allosteric sites play a pivotal role in activating structural fluctuations that allosterically modulate functional signals.},

abstract = {The cAMP-mediated allosteric transition in the catabolite activator protein (CAP; also known as the cAMP receptor protein, CRP) is a textbook example of modulation of DNA-binding activity by small-molecule binding. Here we report the structure of CAP in the absence of cAMP, which, together with structures of CAP in the presence of cAMP, defines atomic details of the cAMP-mediated allosteric transition. The structural changes, and their relationship to cAMP binding and DNA binding, are remarkably clear and simple. Binding of cAMP results in a coil-to-helix transition that extends the coiled-coil dimerization interface of CAP by 3 turns of helix and concomitantly causes rotation, by approximately 60 degrees , and translation, by approximately 7 A, of the DNA-binding domains (DBDs) of CAP, positioning the recognition helices in the DBDs in the correct orientation to interact with DNA. The allosteric transition is stabilized further by expulsion of an aromatic residue from the cAMP-binding pocket upon cAMP binding. The results define the structural mechanisms that underlie allosteric control of this prototypic transcriptional regulatory factor and provide an illustrative example of how effector-mediated structural changes can control the activity of regulatory proteins.},

Typically, rare event acceleration methods require an a priori specification of the event to be accelerated. In recent work, we have demonstrated the application of boxed molecular dynamics to energy space, as a way to accelerate rare events in the stochastic chemical master equation. Here we build upon this work and apply the boxed molecular dynamics algorithm to the energy space of a molecule in classical trajectory simulations. Through this new BXD in energy (BXDE) approach we demonstrate that generic rare events (in this case chemical reactions) may be accelerated by multiple orders of magnitude compared to unbiased simulations. Furthermore, we show that the ratios of products formed from the BXDE simulations are similar to those formed in unbiased simulations at the same temperature.},

abstract = {Chemical shift perturbation (CSP, chemical shift mapping or complexation-induced changes in chemical shift, CIS) follows changes in the chemical shifts of a protein when a ligand is added, and uses these to determine the location of the binding site, the affinity of the ligand, and/or possibly the structure of the complex. A key factor in determining the appearance of spectra during a titration is the exchange rate between free and bound, or more specifically the off-rate koff. When koff is greater than the chemical shift difference between free and bound, which typically equates to an affinity Kd weaker than about 3$\mu$M, then exchange is fast on the chemical shift timescale. Under these circumstances, the observed shift is the population-weighted average of free and bound, which allows Kd to be determined from measurement of peak positions, provided the measurements are made appropriately. (1)H shifts are influenced to a large extent by through-space interactions, whereas (13)C$\alpha$ and (13)C$\beta$ shifts are influenced more by through-bond effects. (15)N and (13)C' shifts are influenced both by through-bond and by through-space (hydrogen bonding) interactions. For determining the location of a bound ligand on the basis of shift change, the most appropriate method is therefore usually to measure (15)N HSQC spectra, calculate the geometrical distance moved by the peak, weighting (15)N shifts by a factor of about 0.14 compared to (1)H shifts, and select those residues for which the weighted shift change is larger than the standard deviation of the shift for all residues. Other methods are discussed, in particular the measurement of (13)CH3 signals. Slow to intermediate exchange rates lead to line broadening, and make Kd values very difficult to obtain. There is no good way to distinguish changes in chemical shift due to direct binding of the ligand from changes in chemical shift due to allosteric change. Ligand binding at multiple sites can often be characterised, by simultaneous fitting of many measured shift changes, or more simply by adding substoichiometric amounts of ligand. The chemical shift changes can be used as restraints for docking ligand onto protein. By use of quantitative calculations of ligand-induced chemical shift changes, it is becoming possible to determine not just the position but also the orientation of ligands.},

abstract = {Allostery is a fundamental mechanism of regulation in biology. The residues at the end points of long-range allosteric perturbations are commonly identified by the comparative analyses of structures and dynamics in apo and effector-bound states. However, the networks of interactions mediating the propagation of allosteric signals between the end points often remain elusive. Here we show that the covariance analysis of NMR chemical shift changes caused by a set of covalently modified analogs of the allosteric effector (i.e., agonists and antagonists) reveals extended networks of coupled residues. Unexpectedly, such networks reach not only sites subject to effector-dependent structural variations, but also regions that are controlled by dynamically driven allostery. In these regions the allosteric signal is propagated mainly by dynamic rather than structural modulations, which result in subtle but highly correlated chemical shift variations. The proposed chemical shift covariance analysis (CHESCA) identifies interresidue correlations based on the combination of agglomerative clustering (AC) and singular value decomposition (SVD). AC results in dendrograms that define functional clusters of coupled residues, while SVD generates score plots that provide a residue-specific dissection of the contributions to binding and allostery. The CHESCA approach was validated by applying it to the cAMP-binding domain of the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) and the CHESCA results are in full agreement with independent mutational data on EPAC activation. Overall, CHESCA is a generally applicable method that utilizes a selected chemical library of effector analogs to quantitatively decode the binding and allosteric information content embedded in chemical shift changes.},

abstract = {The question of protein dynamics and its relevance to function is currently a topic of great interest. Proteins are particularly dynamic at the side-chain level on the time scale of picoseconds to nanoseconds. Here, we present a comparison of NMR-monitored side-chain motion between three PDZ domains of approximately 30% sequence identity and show that the side-chain dynamics display nontrivial conservation. Methyl (2)H relaxation was carried out to determine side-chain order parameters (S(2)), which were found to be more similar than naively expected from sequence, local packing, or a combination of the two. Thus, the dynamics of a rather distant homologue appears to be an excellent predictor of a protein's side-chain dynamics and, on average, better than current structure-based methods. Fast side-chain dynamics therefore display a high level of organization associated with global fold. Beyond simple conservation, the analysis herein suggests that the pattern of side-chain flexibility has significant contributions from nonlocal elements of the PDZ fold, such as correlated motions, and that the conserved dynamics may directly support function.},

abstract = {Although the importance of the C terminus of the $\alpha$ subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-G protein pairing is well established, the structural basis of selective interactions remains unknown. Here, we combine live cell FRET-based measurements and molecular dynamics simulations of the interaction between the GPCR and a peptide derived from the C terminus of the G$\alpha$ subunit (G$\alpha$ peptide) to dissect the molecular mechanisms of G protein selectivity. We observe a direct link between G$\alpha$ peptide binding and stabilization of the GPCR conformational ensemble. We find that cognate and non-cognate G$\alpha$ peptides show deep and shallow binding, respectively, and in distinct orientations within the GPCR. Binding of the cognate G$\alpha$ peptide stabilizes the agonist-bound GPCR conformational ensemble resulting in favorable binding energy and lower flexibility of the agonist-GPCR pair. We identify three hot spot residues (G$\alpha$s/G$\alpha$q-Gln-384/Leu-349, Gln-390/Glu-355, and Glu-392/Asn-357) that contribute to selective interactions between the $\beta$2-adrenergic receptor ($\beta$2-AR)-G$\alpha$s and V1A receptor (V1AR)-G$\alpha$q The G$\alpha$s and G$\alpha$q peptides adopt different orientations in $\beta$2-AR and V1AR, respectively. The $\beta$2-AR/G$\alpha$s peptide interface is dominated by electrostatic interactions, whereas the V1AR/G$\alpha$q peptide interactions are predominantly hydrophobic. Interestingly, our study reveals a role for both favorable and unfavorable interactions in G protein selection. Residue Glu-355 in G$\alpha$q prevents this peptide from interacting strongly with $\beta$2-AR. Mutagenesis to the G$\alpha$s counterpart (E355Q) imparts a cognate-like interaction. Overall, our study highlights the synergy in molecular dynamics and FRET-based approaches to dissect the structural basis of selective G protein interactions.},

At the extracellular surface, the organization of extracellular loop 3 and proximal transmembrane segments differs between our exendin-P5-bound structure and previous GLP-1-bound GLP-1 receptor structure. At the intracellular face, there was a six-degree difference in the angle of the G$\alpha$s-$\alpha$5 helix engagement between structures, which was propagated across the G protein heterotrimer. In addition, the structures differed in the rate and extent of conformational reorganization of the G$\alpha$sprotein. Our structure provides insights into the molecular basis of biased agonism.},

abstract = {Conventional drug discovery efforts at the $\beta$2-adrenoceptor ($\beta$2AR) have led to the development of ligands that bind almost exclusively to the receptor's hormone-binding orthosteric site. However, targeting the largely unexplored and evolutionarily unique allosteric sites has potential for developing more specific drugs with fewer side effects than orthosteric ligands. Using our recently developed approach for screening G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with DNA-encoded small-molecule libraries, we have discovered and characterized the first $\beta$2AR small-molecule positive allosteric modulators (PAMs)-compound (Cmpd)-6 [(R)-N-(4-amino-1-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-4-oxobutan-2-yl)-5-(N-isopropyl-N-methylsulfamoyl)-2-((4-methoxyphenyl)thio)benzamide] and its analogs. We used purified human $\beta$2ARs, occupied by a high-affinity agonist, for the affinity-based screening of over 500 million distinct library compounds, which yielded Cmpd-6. It exhibits a low micro-molar affinity for the agonist-occupied $\beta$2AR and displays positive cooperativity with orthosteric agonists, thereby enhancing their binding to the receptor and ability to stabilize its active state. Cmpd-6 is cooperative with G protein and $\beta$-arrestin1 (a.k.a. arrestin2) to stabilize high-affinity, agonist-bound active states of the $\beta$2AR and potentiates downstream cAMP production and receptor recruitment of $\beta$-arrestin2 (a.k.a. arrestin3). Cmpd-6 is specific for the $\beta$2AR compared with the closely related $\beta$1AR. Structure-activity studies of select Cmpd-6 analogs defined the chemical groups that are critical for its biologic activity. We thus introduce the first small-molecule PAMs for the $\beta$2AR, which may serve as a lead molecule for the development of novel therapeutics. The approach described in this work establishes a broadly applicable proof-of-concept strategy for affinity-based discovery of small-molecule allosteric compounds targeting unique conformational states of GPCRs.},

abstract = {Phospholipase C-$\beta$ (PLC$\beta$) is directly activated by G$\alpha$q, but the molecular basis for how its distal C-terminal domain (CTD) contributes to maximal activity is poorly understood. Herein we present both the crystal structure and cryo-EM three-dimensional reconstructions of human full-length PLC$\beta$3 in complex with mouse G$\alpha$q. The distal CTD forms an extended monomeric helical bundle consisting of three antiparallel segments with structural similarity to membrane-binding bin-amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) domains. Sequence conservation of the distal CTD suggests putative membrane and protein interaction sites, the latter of which bind the N-terminal helix of G$\alpha$q in both the crystal structure and cryo-EM reconstructions. Functional analysis suggests that the distal CTD has roles in membrane targeting and in optimizing the orientation of the catalytic core at the membrane for maximal rates of lipid hydrolysis.},

abstract = {Uveal melanoma (UM) is characterized by mutually exclusive activating mutations in GNAQ, GNA11, CYSLTR2, and PLCB4, four genes in a linear pathway~to activation of PLC$\beta$ in almost all tumors and loss of~BAP1 in the aggressive subset. We generated mice with melanocyte-specific expression~of GNA11Q209L with and without homozygous Bap1 loss. The GNA11Q209L mice recapitulated human Gq-associated melanomas, and they developed pigmented neoplastic lesions from melanocytes of the skin and non-cutaneous organs, including the eye and leptomeninges, as well as at atypical sites, including the lymph nodes and lungs. The addition of Bap1 loss increased tumor proliferation and cutaneous melanoma size. Integrative transcriptome analysis of human and murine melanomas identified RasGRP3 to be specifically expressed in GNAQ/GNA11-driven melanomas. In human UM cell lines and murine models, RasGRP3 is specifically required for GNAQ/GNA11-driven Ras activation and tumorigenesis. This implicates RasGRP3 as a critical node and a potential target in UM.},

Here we show that the triple $\beta$-lactam combination meropenem-piperacillin-tazobactam (ME/PI/TZ) acts synergistically and is bactericidal against MRSA subspecies N315 and 72 other clinical MRSA isolates in vitro and clears MRSA N315 infection in a mouse model. ME/PI/TZ suppresses evolution of resistance in MRSA via reciprocal collateral sensitivity of its constituents. We demonstrate that these activities also extend to other carbapenem-penicillin-$\beta$-lactamase inhibitor combinations. ME/PI/TZ circumvents the tight regulation of the mec and bla operons in MRSA, the basis for inducible resistance to $\beta$-lactam antibiotics. Furthermore, ME/PI/TZ subverts the function of penicillin-binding protein-2a (PBP2a) via allostery, which we propose as the mechanism for both synergy and collateral sensitivity. Showing in vivo activity similar to that of linezolid, ME/PI/TZ demonstrates that combinations of older $\beta$-lactam antibiotics could be effective against MRSA infections in humans.},

abstract = {Characterizing the equilibrium ensemble of folding pathways, including their relative probability, is one of the major challenges in protein folding theory today. Although this information is in principle accessible via all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, it is difficult to compute in practice because protein folding is a rare event and the affordable simulation length is typically not sufficient to observe an appreciable number of folding events, unless very simplified protein models are used. Here we present an approach that allows for the reconstruction of the full ensemble of folding pathways from simulations that are much shorter than the folding time. This approach can be applied to all-atom protein simulations in explicit solvent. It does not use a predefined reaction coordinate but is based on partitioning the state space into small conformational states and constructing a Markov model between them. A theory is presented that allows for the extraction of the full ensemble of transition pathways from the unfolded to the folded configurations. The approach is applied to the folding of a PinWW domain in explicit solvent where the folding time is two orders of magnitude larger than the length of individual simulations. The results are in good agreement with kinetic experimental data and give detailed insights about the nature of the folding process which is shown to be surprisingly complex and parallel. The analysis reveals the existence of misfolded trap states outside the network of efficient folding intermediates that significantly reduce the folding speed.},

abstract = {G-protein alpha subunits consist of two domains: a Ras-like domain also called GTPase domain (GTPaseD), structurally homologous to monomeric G-proteins, and a more divergent domain, unique to heterotrimeric G-proteins, called helical domain (HD). G-protein activation, requires the exchange of bound GDP for GTP, and since the guanine nucleotide is buried in a deep cleft between both domains, it has been postulated that activation may involve a conformational change that will allow the opening of this cleft. Therefore, it has been proposed, that interdomain interactions are playing an important role in regulating the nucleotide exchange rate of the alpha subunit. While constructing different Gs(alpha) quimeras, we identified a Gs(alpha) random mutant, which was very inefficient in stimulating adenylyl cyclase activity. The introduced mutation corresponded to the substitution of Ser(111) for Asn (S111N), located in the carboxi terminal end of helix A of the HD, a region neither involved in AC interaction nor in the interdomain interface. In order to characterize this mutant, we expressed it in bacteria, purified it by niquel-agarose chromatography, and studied its nucleotide exchange properties. We demonstrated that the recombinant S111N Gs(alpha) was functional since it was able to undergo the characteristic conformational change upon GTP binding, detected by the acquisition of a trypsin-resistant conformation. When the biochemical properties were determined, the mutant protein exhibited a reduced GDP dissociation kinetics and as a consequence a slower GTPgammaS binding rate that was responsible for a diminished adenylyl cyclase activation when GTPgammaS was used as activator. These data provide new evidence that involves the HD as a regulator of Gs(alpha) function, in this case the alphaA helix, which is not directly involved with the nucleotide binding site nor the interdomain interface.},

abstract = {The string method is a molecular-simulation technique that aims to calculate the minimum free-energy path of a chemical reaction or conformational transition, in the space of a pre-defined set of reaction coordinates that is typically highly dimensional. Any descriptor may be used as a reaction coordinate, but arguably the Cartesian coordinates of the atoms involved are the most unprejudiced and intuitive choice. Cartesian coordinates, however, present a non-trivial problem, in that they are not invariant to rigid-body molecular rotations and translations, which ideally ought to be unrestricted in the simulations. To overcome this difficulty, we reformulate the framework of the string method to integrate an on-the-fly structural-alignment algorithm. This approach, referred to as SOMA (String method with Optimal Molecular Alignment), enables the use of Cartesian reaction coordinates in freely tumbling molecular systems. In addition, this scheme permits the dissection of the free-energy change along the most probable path into individual atomic contributions, thus revealing the dominant mechanism of the simulated process. This detailed analysis also provides a physically-meaningful criterion to coarse-grain the representation of the path. To demonstrate the accuracy of the method we analyze the isomerization of the alanine dipeptide in vacuum and the chair-to-inverted-chair transition of $\beta$-D mannose in explicit water. Notwithstanding the simplicity of these systems, the SOMA approach reveals novel insights into the atomic mechanism of these isomerizations. In both cases, we find that the dynamics and the energetics of these processes are controlled by interactions involving only a handful of atoms in each molecule. Consistent with this result, we show that a coarse-grained SOMA calculation defined in terms of these subsets of atoms yields nearidentical minimum free-energy paths and committor distributions to those obtained via a highly-dimensional string.},

abstract = {Activation of heterotrimeric G proteins by cytoplasmic nonreceptor proteins is an alternative to the classical mechanism via G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). A subset of nonreceptor G protein activators is characterized by a conserved sequence named the G$\alpha$-binding and activating (GBA) motif, which confers guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity in vitro and promotes G protein-dependent signaling in cells. GBA proteins have important roles in physiology and disease but remain greatly understudied. This is due, in part, to the lack of efficient tools that specifically disrupt GBA motif function in the context of the large multifunctional proteins in which they are embedded. This hindrance to the study of alternative mechanisms of G protein activation contrasts with the wealth of convenient chemical and genetic tools to manipulate GPCR-dependent activation. Here, we describe the rational design and implementation of a genetically encoded protein that specifically inhibits GBA motifs: GBA inhibitor (GBAi). GBAi was engineered by introducing modifications in G$\alpha$i that preclude coupling to every known major binding partner [GPCRs, G$\beta$$\gamma$, effectors, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), or the chaperone/GEF Ric-8A], while favoring high-affinity binding to all known GBA motifs. We demonstrate that GBAi does not interfere with canonical GPCR-G protein signaling but blocks GBA-dependent signaling in cancer cells. Furthermore, by implementing GBAi in vivo, we show that GBA-dependent signaling modulates phenotypes during Xenopus laevis embryonic development. In summary, GBAi is a selective, efficient, and convenient tool to dissect the biological processes controlled by a GPCR-independent mechanism of G protein activation mediated by cytoplasmic factors.},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of cell surface signaling proteins, participate in nearly all physiological processes, and are the targets of 30% of marketed drugs. Typically, nanomolar to micromolar concentrations of ligand are used to activate GPCRs in experimental systems. We detected GPCR responses to a wide range of ligand concentrations, from attomolar to millimolar, by measuring GPCR-stimulated production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with high spatial and temporal resolution. Mathematical modeling showed that femtomolar concentrations of ligand activated, on average, 40% of the cells in a population provided that a cell was activated by one to two binding events. Furthermore, activation of the endogenous $\beta$2-adrenergic receptor ($\beta$2AR) and muscarinic acetylcholine M3 receptor (M3R) by femtomolar concentrations of ligand in cell lines and human cardiac fibroblasts caused sustained increases in nuclear translocation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cytosolic protein kinase C (PKC) activity, respectively. These responses were spatially and temporally distinct from those that occurred in response to higher concentrations of ligand and resulted in a distinct cellular proteomic profile. This highly sensitive signaling depended on the GPCRs forming preassembled, higher-order signaling complexes at the plasma membrane. Recognizing that GPCRs respond to ultralow concentrations of neurotransmitters and hormones challenges established paradigms of drug action and provides a previously unappreciated aspect of GPCR activation that is quite distinct from that typically observed with higher ligand concentrations.},

abstract = {The 3 human RAS genes, KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS, encode 4 different RAS proteins which belong to the protein family of small GTPases that function as binary molecular switches involved in cell signaling. Activating mutations in RAS are among the most common oncogenic drivers in human cancers, with KRAS being the most frequently mutated oncogene. Although KRAS is an excellent drug discovery target for many cancers, and despite decades of research, no therapeutic agent directly targeting RAS has been clinically approved. Using structure-based drug design, we have discovered BI-2852 (1), a KRAS inhibitor that binds with nanomolar affinity to a pocket, thus far perceived to be "undruggable," between switch I and II on RAS; 1 is mechanistically distinct from covalent KRASG12C inhibitors because it binds to a different pocket present in both the active and inactive forms of KRAS. In doing so, it blocks all GEF, GAP, and effector interactions with KRAS, leading to inhibition of downstream signaling and an antiproliferative effect in the low micromolar range in KRAS mutant cells. These findings clearly demonstrate that this so-called switch I/II pocket is indeed druggable and provide the scientific community with a chemical probe that simultaneously targets the active and inactive forms of KRAS.},

abstract = {Recent single-molecule experiments probed transition paths of biomolecular folding and, in particular, measured the time biomolecules spend while crossing their free energy barriers. A surprising finding from these studies is that the transition barriers crossed by transition paths, as inferred from experimentally observed transition path times, are often lower than the independently determined free energy barriers. Here we explore memory effects leading to anomalous diffusion as a possible origin of this discrepancy. Our analysis of several molecular dynamics trajectories shows that the dynamics of common reaction coordinates used to describe protein folding is subdiffusive, at least at sufficiently short times. We capture this effect using a one-dimensional fractional Brownian motion (FBM) model, in which the system undergoes a subdiffusive process in the presence of a potential of mean force, and show that this model yields much broader distributions of transition path times with stretched exponential long-time tails. Without any adjustable parameters, these distributions agree well with the transition path times computed directly from protein trajectories. We further discuss how the FBM model can be tested experimentally.},

For example, long-range intraprotein communication can occur without measurable conformational change and is often not captured by existing structural correlation functions. It is shown here that important functional information is encoded in the timing of protein motions, rather than motion itself. I introduce the conditional activity function to quantify such timing correlations among the degrees of freedom within proteins. For three proteins, the conditional activities between side-chain dihedral angles were computed using the output of microseconds-long atomistic simulations. The new approach demonstrates that a sparse fraction of side-chain pairs are dynamically correlated over long distances (spanning protein lengths up to 7 nm), in sharp contrast to structural correlations, which are short-ranged (<1 nm). Regions of high self- and inter-side-chain dynamical correlations are found, corresponding to experimentally determined functional modules and allosteric connections, respectively.},

abstract = {Hydrogen bond networks play a critical role in determining the stability and specificity of biomolecular complexes, and the ability to design such networks is important for engineering novel structures, interactions, and enzymes. One key feature of hydrogen bond networks that makes them difficult to rationally engineer is that they are highly cooperative and are not energetically favorable until the hydrogen bonding potential has been satisfied for all buried polar groups in the network. Existing computational methods for protein design are ill-equipped for creating these highly cooperative networks because they rely on energy functions and sampling strategies that are focused on pairwise interactions. To enable the design of complex hydrogen bond networks, we have developed a new sampling protocol in the molecular modeling program Rosetta that explicitly searches for sets of amino acid mutations that can form self-contained hydrogen bond networks. For a given set of designable residues, the protocol often identifies many alternative sets of mutations/networks, and we show that it can readily be applied to large sets of residues at protein-protein interfaces or in the interior of proteins. The protocol builds on a recently developed method in Rosetta for designing hydrogen bond networks that has been experimentally validated for small symmetric systems but was not extensible to many larger protein structures and complexes. The sampling protocol we describe here not only recapitulates previously validated designs with performance improvements but also yields viable hydrogen bond networks for cases where the previous method fails, such as the design of large, asymmetric interfaces relevant to engineering protein-based therapeutics.},

Using new mutational approaches, we report a comprehensive experimental study of all 213 mutants that link two phenotypically distinct variants of the Entacmaea quadricolor fluorescent protein-an opportunity to examine epistasis up to the 13th order. The data show the existence of many high-order epistatic interactions between mutations, but also reveal extraordinary sparsity, enabling novel experimental and computational strategies for learning the relevant epistasis. We demonstrate that such information, in turn, can be used to accurately predict phenotypes in practical situations where the number of measurements is limited. Finally, we show how the observed epistasis shapes the solution space of single-mutation trajectories between the parental fluorescent proteins, informative about the protein's evolutionary potential. This work provides conceptual and experimental strategies to profoundly characterize epistasis in a protein, relevant to both natural and laboratory evolution.},

abstract = {To characterize experimentally the ruggedness of the free energy landscape of protein folding is challenging, because the distributed small free energy barriers are usually dominated by one, or a few, large activation free energy barriers. This study delineates changes in the roughness of the free energy landscape by making use of the observation that a decrease in ruggedness is accompanied invariably by an increase in folding cooperativity. Hydrogen exchange (HX) coupled to mass spectrometry was used to detect transient sampling of local energy minima and the global unfolded state on the free energy landscape of the small protein single-chain monellin. Under native conditions, local noncooperative openings result in interconversions between Boltzmann-distributed intermediate states, populated on an extremely rugged "uphill" energy landscape. The cooperativity of these interconversions was increased by selectively destabilizing the native state via mutations, and further by the addition of a chemical denaturant. The perturbation of stability alone resulted in seven backbone amide sites exchanging cooperatively. The size of the cooperatively exchanging and/or unfolding unit did not depend on the extent of protein destabilization. Only upon the addition of a denaturant to a destabilized mutant variant did seven additional backbone amide sites exchange cooperatively. Segmentwise analysis of the HX kinetics of the mutant variants further confirmed that the observed increase in cooperativity was due to the smoothing of the ruggedness of the free energy landscape of folding of the protein by the chemical denaturant.},

Recently, a family of approaches commonly referred to as relative binding free energy (RBFE) calculations, which rely on physics-based molecular simulations and statistical mechanics, have shown promise in reliably generating accurate predictions in the context of drug discovery projects. This advance arises from accumulating developments in the underlying scientific methods (decades of research on force fields and sampling algorithms) coupled with vast increases in computational resources (graphics processing units and cloud infrastructures). Mounting evidence from retrospective validation studies, blind challenge predictions, and prospective applications suggests that RBFE simulations can now predict the affinity differences for congeneric ligands with sufficient accuracy and throughput to deliver considerable value in hit-to-lead and lead optimization efforts. Here, we present an overview of current RBFE implementations, highlighting recent advances and remaining challenges, along with examples that emphasize practical considerations for obtaining reliable RBFE results. We focus specifically on relative binding free energies because the calculations are less computationally intensive than absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations and map directly onto the hit-to-lead and lead optimization processes, where the prediction of relative binding energies between a reference molecule and new ideas (virtual molecules) can be used to prioritize molecules for synthesis. We describe the critical aspects of running RBFE calculations, from both theoretical and applied perspectives, using a combination of retrospective literature examples and prospective studies from drug discovery projects. This work is intended to provide a contemporary overview of the scientific, technical, and practical issues associated with running relative binding free energy simulations, with a focus on real-world drug discovery applications. We offer guidelines for improving the accuracy of RBFE simulations, especially for challenging cases, and emphasize unresolved issues that could be improved by further research in the field.},

abstract = {This volume summarizes our current understanding of the structural basis of the functions of arrestin family of proteins. Arrestins were first discovered as key players in the desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Recent studies showed that arrestins are important signal transducers in their own right, organizing multi-protein complexes and scaffolding numerous signaling cascades that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptotic death. Here arrestin functions are described primarily from the structural prospective. The book covers basal structure of arrestin proteins, receptor binding-induced conformational changes in arrestins, as well as the structure of {\textquotedblleft}pre-activated{\textquotedblright} mutants. Particular focus is on the arrestin elements interacting with numerous binding partners, GPCRs and cytoplasmic signaling proteins. We expect that this information and insights will help to understand and exploit the phenomenon of signaling bias, which is a new promising direction in drug discovery. The chapters are written by the world-class specialists in the field, mostly the people who actually contributed the data discussed. The book gives coherent historical prospective and describes the most recent findings. The book would be particularly useful for scientists in academia and industry working in the fields of pharmacology, cell biology, structural biology, and drug discovery. We expect that the focus on the molecular basis of protein-protein interactions would help to develop novel tools for engaging this important type of targets for research and therapeutic purposes.},

abstract = {X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) refers to the details of how X-rays are absorbed by an atom at energies near and above the core-level binding energies of that particular atom. The absorption of X-rays on the high energy side of absorption edges does not vary monotonically in condensed matter but has a complicated behavior which extends past the edge up to about {\textasciitilde}1 keV. This non-monotonic variation has received the name of X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS). The X-ray absorption fine structure is typically divided into two regimes: X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). This review describes the basic phenomenon of XAFS, theory of EXAFS and the method of extracting structural parameters by EXAFS which relate to the local environment surrounding the absorbing atom. Also, it has been pointed out that XANES can be used to extract information about the oxidation state, three dimensional geometry, and coordination environment of elements under investigation. There are numerous examples of the applications of the XAFS in various fields in the literature. Some selected examples are cited here and discussed so as to give the reader a glimpse of the usefulness and versatility of the XAFS. The two types of EXAFS beamlines available at the synchrotron facilities have been described. The details of BL-8 dispersive EXAFS beamline at 2 GeV Indus-2 synchrotron source at Raja Ramanna Center for Advanced Technology (RRCAT), Indore, India have been given. For the last fifty years research workers in India have been doing XAFS experiments on laboratory set-ups. Now, it is hoped that research workers from Indian laboratories will do experiments on synchrotrons. Hence, details regarding experiment and analysis of the XAFS data have been given in this review so that any one who wants to do research work in the field of XAFS may get necessary information at one place. This is important because the EXAFS beamlines at the Indus-2 synchrotron have become easily available to Indian workers which were not available until now.},

abstract = {To date, the slowest-folding proteins folded ab initio by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have had folding times in the range of nanoseconds to microseconds. We report simulations of several folding trajectories of NTL9(1-39), a protein which has a folding time of approximately 1.5 ms. Distributed molecular dynamics simulations in implicit solvent on GPU processors were used to generate ensembles of trajectories out to approximately 40 micros for several temperatures and starting states. At a temperature less than the melting point of the force field, we observe a small number of productive folding events, consistent with predictions from a model of parallel uncoupled two-state simulations. The posterior distribution of the folding rate predicted from the data agrees well with the experimental folding rate (approximately 640/s). Markov State Models (MSMs) built from the data show a gap in the implied time scales indicative of two-state folding and heterogeneous pathways connecting diffuse mesoscopic substates. Structural analysis of the 14 out of 2000 macrostates transited by the top 10 folding pathways reveals that native-like pairing between strands 1 and 2 only occurs for macrostates with p(fold) > 0.5, suggesting beta(12) hairpin formation may be rate-limiting. We believe that using simulation data such as these to seed adaptive resampling simulations will be a promising new method for achieving statistically converged descriptions of folding landscapes at longer time scales than ever before.},

Crystal structures of GPCRs and their much larger binding partners were consistent with the idea that two receptors might engage a single G protein, GRK, or arrestin. However, recent biophysical, biochemical, and structural evidence invariably suggests that a single GPCR binds G proteins, GRKs, and arrestins.

The approach relates conditional probabilities to the probabilities of the corresponding state transitions. This in turn characterises transfer entropy as a difference of two entropy rates: the rate for a resultant transition and another rate for a possibly irreversible transition within the system affected by an additional source. We then show that this difference, the local transfer entropy, is proportional to the external entropy production, possibly due to irreversibility. Near equilibrium, transfer entropy is also interpreted as the difference in equilibrium stabilities with respect to two scenarios: a default case and the case with an additional source. Finally, we demonstrated that such a thermodynamic treatment is not applicable to information flow, a measure of causal effect.},

abstract = {An approach to find transition pathways in complex systems is presented. The method, which is related to the string method in collective variables of Maragliano et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 2006, 125, 024106), is conceptually simple and straightforward to implement. It consists of refining a putative transition path in the multidimensional space supported by a set of collective variables using the average dynamic drift of those variables. This drift is estimated on-the-fly via swarms of short unbiased trajectories started at different points along the path. Successive iterations of this algorithm, which can be naturally distributed over many computer nodes with negligible interprocessor communication, refine an initial trial path toward the most probable transition path (MPTP) between two stable basins. The method is first tested by determining the pathway for the C7eq to C7ax transition in an all-atom model of the alanine dipeptide in vacuum, which has been studied previously with the string method in collective variables. A transition path is found with a committor distribution peaked at 1/2 near the free energy maximum, in accord with previous results. Last, the method is applied to the allosteric conformational change in the nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC), represented here with a two-state elastic network model. Even though more than 550 collective variables are used to describe the conformational change, the path converges rapidly. Again, the committor distribution is found to be peaked around 1/2 near the free energy maximum between the two stable states, confirming that a genuine transition state has been localized in this complex multidimensional system.},

abstract = {In broad terms, percolation theory describes the conditions under which clusters of nodes are fully connected in a random network. A percolation phase transition occurs when, as edges are added to a network, its largest connected cluster abruptly jumps from insignificance to complete dominance. In this article, we apply percolation theory to meticulously constructed networks of protein folding dynamics called Markov state models. As rare fluctuations are systematically repressed (or reintroduced), we observe percolation-like phase transitions in protein folding networks: whole sets of conformational states switch from nearly complete isolation to complete connectivity in a rapid fashion. We analyze the general and critical properties of these phase transitions in seven protein systems and discuss how closely dynamics on protein folding landscapes relate to percolation on random lattices.},

abstract = {Complex systems are increasingly being viewed as distributed information processing systems, particularly in the domains of computational neuroscience, bioinformatics and Artificial Life. This trend has resulted in a strong uptake in the use of (Shannon) information-theoretic measures to analyse the dynamics of complex systems in these fields. We introduce the Java Information Dynamics Toolkit (JIDT): a Google code project which provides a standalone, (GNU GPL v3 licensed) open-source code implementation for empirical estimation of information-theoretic measures from time-series data. While the toolkit provides classic information-theoretic measures (e.g. entropy, mutual information, conditional mutual information), it ultimately focusses on implementing higher-level measures for information dynamics. That is, JIDT focusses on quantifying information storage, transfer and modification, and the dynamics of these operations in space and time. For this purpose, it includes implementations of the transfer entropy and active information storage, their multivariate extensions and local or pointwise variants. JIDT provides implementations for both discrete and continuous-valued data for each measure, including various types of estimator for continuous data (e.g. Gaussian, box-kernel and Kraskov-Stoegbauer-Grassberger) which can be swapped at run-time due to Java's object-oriented polymorphism. Furthermore, while written in Java, the toolkit can be used directly in MATLAB, GNU Octave, Python and other environments. We present the principles behind the code design, and provide several examples to guide users.

abstract = {The causative role of G protein-couple receptor (GPCR) pathway mutations in uveal melanoma has been well established. Nearly all UMs bear an activating mutation in a GPCR pathway mediated by G proteins of the Gq/11 family, driving tumor initiation and possibly metastatic progression. Thus, targeting this pathway holds therapeutic promise for managing UM. However, direct targeting of oncogenic G$\alpha$q/11 mutants, present in {\textasciitilde}90% of UMs, is complicated by the belief that these mutants structurally resemble active G$\alpha$q/11 wild-type. This notion is solidly founded on previous studies characterizing G$\alpha$ mutants in which a conserved catalytic glutamine (Q209 in G$\alpha$q) is replaced by leucine, which leads to GTPase function deficiency and constitutive activation. While Q209L accounts for approximately half of GNAQ mutations in UM, Q209P is as frequent as Q209L and also promotes oncogenesis, but has not been characterized at the molecular level. Here we characterized the biochemical and signaling properties of G$\alpha$q Q209P, and found that it is also GTPase-deficient and activates downstream signaling as efficiently as G$\alpha$q Q209L. However, G$\alpha$q Q209P had distinct molecular and functional features, including in the switch II region of G$\alpha$q Q209P, which adopted a conformation different from that of G$\alpha$q Q209L or active wild-type G$\alpha$q, resulting in altered binding to effectors, G$\beta$$\gamma$ and Regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins. Our findings reveal that the molecular properties of G$\alpha$q Q209P are fundamentally different from those in other active G$\alpha$q proteins and could be leveraged as a specific vulnerability for the {\textasciitilde}20% of UMs bearing this mutation.},

abstract = {Detailed understanding of how conformational dynamics orchestrates function in allosteric regulation of recognition and catalysis remains ambiguous. Here, we simulate CypA using multiple-microsecond-long atomistic molecular dynamics in explicit solvent and carry out NMR experiments. We analyze a large amount of time-dependent multidimensional data with a coarse-grained approach and map key dynamical features within individual macrostates by defining dynamics in terms of residue-residue contacts. The effects of substrate binding are observed to be largely sensed at a location over 15 {\AA} from the active site, implying its importance in allostery. Using NMR experiments, we confirm that a dynamic cluster of residues in this distal region is directly coupled to the active site. Furthermore, the dynamical network of interresidue contacts is found to be coupled and temporally dispersed, ranging over 4 to 5 orders of magnitude. Finally, using network centrality measures we demonstrate the changes in the communication network, connectivity, and influence of CypA residues upon substrate binding, mutation, and during catalysis. We identify key residues that potentially act as a bottleneck in the communication flow through the distinct regions in CypA and, therefore, as targets for future mutational studies. Mapping these dynamical features and the coupling of dynamics to function has crucial ramifications in understanding allosteric regulation in enzymes and proteins, in general.},

The analytics takes advantage of the detailed time series available from biomolecular computer simulations, and it yields spatial heat maps that can be visualized on 3D molecular structures or in the form of interaction networks. The speed of our efficient mutual information solver is on the order of a basic Pearson cross-correlation calculation. We demonstrate that the FIM method is superior to linear cross-correlation for the detection of nonlinear dependence in challenging situations where measures for the global dynamics (the "activity") diverge. The analytics is applied to the detection of hinge-bending hot spots and to the prediction of pairwise contacts between residues that are relevant for the global activity exhibited by the molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. Application examples from various MD laboratories include the millisecond bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) trajectory using canonical MD, a Gaussian accelerated MD folding trajectory of chignolin, and the heat-induced unfolding of engrailed homeodomain (EnHD). The FIM implementation will be freely disseminated with our open-source package, TimeScapes.},

A novel application of the dynamical cross-correlation matrix (DCCM) analysis tool was used to help identify putative protein domains. In implementing this new approach, several DCCM maps were calculated, each using a different coordinate reference frame from which protein domain boundaries and protein domain residue constituents could be identified. Cytochrome P450BM-3, from Bacillus megaterium, was used as the model protein in this study. The analyses indicated that the simulated protein comprises three distinct domain regions; in contrast, only two protein domains were identified in the original crystal structure report. Specifically, the DCCM analyses showed that the F-G helix region was a separate domain entity and not a part of the alpha domain, as previously designated. The simulations demonstrated that the domain motions of the F-G helix region effected both the size and shape of the enzyme active site, and that the dynamics of the F-G helix domain could possibly control access of substrate to the binding pocket.},

abstract = {Activating mutations in G protein $\alpha$ subunits cause various diseases, including some forms of uveal melanoma (UM), an aggressive eye cancer. Onken et al . found that the plant-derived compound FR900359 blocked the growth of G$\alpha$-mutant UM cells in culture. FR900359 allosterically inhibited the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of constitutively active G$\alpha$q, thereby trapping it in inactive heterotrimers. The loss of G$\alpha$q signaling in UM cells induced redifferentiation and cell death. Targeting this compound, if safe, or synthetic derivatives to the uveal tumor tissue may be an effective treatment for patients. Constitutively active G protein $\alpha$ subunits cause cancer, cholera, Sturge-Weber syndrome, and other disorders. Therapeutic intervention by targeted inhibition of constitutively active G$\alpha$ subunits in these disorders has yet to be achieved. We found that constitutively active G$\alpha$q in uveal melanoma (UM) cells was inhibited by the cyclic depsipeptide FR900359 (FR). FR allosterically inhibited guanosine diphosphate{\textendash}for{\textendash}guanosine triphosphate (GDP/GTP) exchange to trap constitutively active G$\alpha$q in inactive, GDP-bound G$\alpha$$\beta$$\gamma$ heterotrimers. Allosteric inhibition of other G$\alpha$ subunits was achieved by the introduction of an FR-binding site. In UM cells driven by constitutively active G$\alpha$q, FR inhibited second messenger signaling, arrested cell proliferation, reinstated melanocytic differentiation, and stimulated apoptosis. In contrast, FR had no effect on BRAF -driven UM cells. FR promoted UM cell differentiation by reactivating polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2){\textendash}mediated gene silencing, a heretofore unrecognized effector system of constitutively active G$\alpha$q in UM. Constitutively active G$\alpha$q and PRC2 therefore provide therapeutic targets for UM. The development of FR analogs specific for other G$\alpha$ subunit subtypes may provide novel therapeutic approaches for diseases driven by constitutively active G$\alpha$ subunits or multiple G protein{\textendash}coupled receptors (GPCRs) where targeting a single receptor is ineffective.},

For the PDZ domain family, this analysis predicted a set of energetically coupled positions for a binding site residue that includes unexpected long-range interactions. Mutational studies confirm these predictions, demonstrating that the statistical energy function is a good indicator of thermodynamic coupling in proteins. Sets of interacting residues form connected pathways through the protein fold that may be the basis for efficient energy conduction within proteins.},

Markov state models (MSMs) can be useful in analyzing such data sets, but in particularly complex landscapes, the available trajectory data may prove insufficient for constructing valid Markov models. Here, we explore the potential utility of history-dependent analyses applied to relatively poor decompositions of configuration space for which MSMs are inadequate. Our approaches build on previous work [Suarez et. al., JCTC 2014] showing that, with sufficient history information, unbiased equilibrium and non-equilibrium observables can be obtained even for arbitrary non-Markovian divisions of phase space. We explore a range of non-Markovian approximations using varying amounts of history information to model the finite length of trajectory segments, applying the analyses to toy models as well as several proteins previously studied by microsec-milisec scale atomistic simulations [Lindorff-Larsen et. al., Science 2011].},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:To test the hypothesis that increased cardiac adenylyl cyclase type VI (AC(VI)) content, which results in increased cAMP generation, would increase survival in cardiomyopathy, we crossbred mice with Gq-associated cardiomyopathy and those with cardiac-directed expression of AC(VI). We also assessed myocardial hypertrophy after prolonged cardiac expression of Gq versus coexpression of Gq and AC(VI).

METHODS AND RESULTS:Three experimental groups, Gq/AC (double positive), Gq, and control (double negative), were studied. Survival was increased by cardiac-directed expression of AC(VI) (P<0.0001), and Gq/AC mice had survival rates indistinguishable from control mice. Myocardial hypertrophy developed in older Gq mice but was abrogated by cardiac expression of AC(VI), as documented by the ratio of ventricular weight to tibial length (Gq, 11.93+/-0.99 mg/mm, n=11; Gq/AC, 8.00+/-0.73 mg/mm, n=9; P<0.01) and by left ventricular cardiac myocyte size (Gq, 2800+/-254 microm2, n=4; Gq/AC, 1721+/-166 microm2, n=5; P<0.01). Hearts of Gq mice were dilated, and function was impaired. Concurrent expression of AC reduced end-diastolic diameter (Gq, 4.20+/-0.15 mm, n=12; Gq/AC, 3.68+/-0.12 mm, n=7; P<0.05) and increased fractional shortening (Gq, 32+/-1%, n=12; Gq/AC, 41+/-2%, n=7; P<0.001). Cardiac myocytes from Gq/AC mice showed increased forskolin-stimulated cAMP production (Gq, 3.8+/-1.3 fmol/cell, n=5; Gq/AC, 10.7+/-2.6 fmol/cell, n=6; P<0.02), documenting increased AC function.

CONCLUSIONS:Cardiac-directed expression of AC(VI) restores myocyte AC function, improves heart function, increases cAMP generation, abrogates myocardial hypertrophy, and increases survival in Gq cardiomyopathy.},

The centerpiece was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes factor as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: {\textbullet} From Jeffreys' Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. {\textbullet} Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. {\textbullet} Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the ...},

abstract = {Water has a profound effect on the dynamics of biomolecules and governs many biological processes, leading to the concept that function is slaved to solvent dynamics within and surrounding the biomolecule. Protein conformational changes on $\mu$s-ms time scales are frequently associated with protein function, but little is known about the behavior of protein-bound water on these time scales. Here we have used NMR relaxation dispersion measurements to probe the tryptophan indoles in the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). We find that during structural changes on the $\mu$s-ms time scale, large chemical shift changes are often observed for the NH proton on the indole ring, while relatively smaller chemical shift changes are observed for the ring nitrogen atom. Comparison with experimental chemical shifts and density functional theory-based chemical shift predictions show that during the structural change the tryptophan indole NHs remain bound to water, but the geometry of the protein-bound water networks changes. These results establish that relaxation dispersion measurements can indirectly probe water dynamics and indicate that water can influence, or be influenced by, protein conformational changes on the $\mu$s-ms time scale. Our data show that structurally conserved bound water molecules can play a critical role in transmitting information between functionally important regions of the protein and provide evidence that internal protein motions can be coupled through the mediation of hydrogen-bonded water bound in the protein structure.},

abstract = {Molecular mechanics models have been applied extensively to study the dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids. Here we report the development of a third-generation point-charge all-atom force field for proteins. Following the earlier approach of Cornell et al., the charge set was obtained by fitting to the electrostatic potentials of dipeptides calculated using B3LYP/cc-pVTZ//HF/6-31G** quantum mechanical methods. The main-chain torsion parameters were obtained by fitting to the energy profiles of Ace-Ala-Nme and Ace-Gly-Nme di-peptides calculated using MP2/cc-pVTZ//HF/6-31G** quantum mechanical methods. All other parameters were taken from the existing AMBER data base. The major departure from previous force fields is that all quantum mechanical calculations were done in the condensed phase with continuum solvent models and an effective dielectric constant of epsilon = 4. We anticipate that this force field parameter set will address certain critical short comings of previous force fields in condensed-phase simulations of proteins. Initial tests on peptides demonstrated a high-degree of similarity between the calculated and the statistically measured Ramanchandran maps for both Ace-Gly-Nme and Ace-Ala-Nme di-peptides. Some highlights of our results include (1) well-preserved balance between the extended and helical region distributions, and (2) favorable type-II poly-proline helical region in agreement with recent experiments. Backward compatibility between the new and Cornell et al. charge sets, as judged by overall agreement between dipole moments, allows a smooth transition to the new force field in the area of ligand-binding calculations. Test simulations on a large set of proteins are also discussed.},

Instead of adding Gaussians with assigned height and width in conventional metadynamics method, here we add a more realistic adaptive biasing potential to the Hamiltonian of the system. The shape of the adaptive biasing potential is adjusted on the fly by sampling over the visited states. As the top of the barrier is approached, the biasing potentials become wider. This decreases the problem of trapping the system in the niches, introduced by the addition of Gaussians of fixed height in metadynamics. Our results for the free energy profiles of three test systems show that this method is more accurate and converges more quickly than the conventional metadynamics, and is quite comparable (in accuracy and convergence rate) with the well-tempered metadynamics method. {\textcopyright} 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Here we suggest that conformational selection takes place not once in a given binding/allosteric event, but at every step along the allosteric pathway. This view generalizes conformational selection and makes it applicable also to other allosteric events, such as post-translational modifications (PTMs) and photon absorption. Similar to binding, at each step along a propagation pathway, conformational selection is coupled with induced fit which optimizes the interactions. Thus, as in binding, the allosteric effects induced by PTMs and light relate not only to population shift; but to conformational selection as well. Conformational selection and population shift take place conjointly.},

abstract = {The original formulation of the string method in collective variable space is compared with a recent variant called string method with swarms-of-trajectories. The assumptions made in the original method are revisited and the significance of the minimum free energy path (MFEP) is discussed in the context of reactive events. These assumptions are compared to those made in the string method with swarms-of-trajectories, and shown to be equivalent in a certain regime: in particular an expression for the path identified by the swarms-of-trajectories method is given and shown to be closely related to the MFEP. Finally, the algorithmic aspects of both methods are compared.},

abstract = {We introduce an extension of a recently published method [ Mendels et al. J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2018 , 9 , 2776 - 2781 ] to obtain low-dimensional collective variables for studying multiple states free energy processes in chemical reactions. The only information needed is a collection of simple statistics of the equilibrium properties of the reactants and product states. No information on the reaction mechanism has to be given. The method allows studying a large variety of chemical reactivity problems including multiple reaction pathways, isomerization, and stereo- and regiospecificity. We applied the method to two fundamental organic chemical reactions. First we study the SN2 nucleophilic substitution reaction of a Cl in CH2Cl2 leading to an understanding of the kinetic origin of the chirality inversion in such processes. Subsequently, we tackle the problem of regioselectivity in the hydrobromination of propene revealing that the nature of empirical observations such as Markovnikov's rule lies in the chemical kinetics rather than the thermodynamic stability of the products.},

abstract = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large group of membrane-bound receptor proteins that are involved in a plethora of diverse processes (e.g., vision, hormone response). In mammals, and particularly in humans, GPCRs are involved in many signal transduction pathways and, as such, are heavily studied for their immense pharmaceutical potential. Indeed, a large fraction of drugs target various GPCRs, and drug-development is often aimed at GPCRs. Therefore, understanding the activation of GPCRs is a challenge of major importance both from fundamental and practical considerations. And yet, despite the remarkable progress in structural understanding, we still do not have a translation of the structural information to an energy-based picture. Here we use coarse-grained (CG) modeling to chart the free-energy landscape of the activation process of the $\beta$-2 adrenergic receptor ($\beta$2AR) as a representative GPCR. The landscape provides the needed tool for analyzing the processes that lead to activation of the receptor upon binding of the ligand (adrenaline) while limiting constitutive activation. Our results pave the way to better understand the biological mechanisms of action of the $\beta$2AR and GPCRs, from a physical chemistry point of view rather than simply by observing the receptor's behavior physiologically.},

abstract = {K-Ras is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancers, but there are still no drugs that directly target it in the clinic. Recent studies utilizing dynamics information show promising results for selectively targeting mutant K-Ras. However, despite extensive characterization, the mechanisms by which K-Ras residue fluctuations transfer allosteric regulatory information remain unknown. Understanding the direction of information flow can provide new mechanistic insights for K-Ras targeting. Here, we present a novel approach -conditional time-delayed correlations (CTC) - using the motions of all residue pairs of a protein to predict directionality in the allosteric regulation of the protein fluctuations. Analyzing nucleotide-dependent intrinsic K-Ras motions with the new approach yields predictions that agree with the literature, showing that GTP-binding stabilizes K-Ras motions and leads to residue correlations with relatively long characteristic decay times. Furthermore, our study is the first to identify driver-follower relationships in correlated motions of K-Ras residue pairs, revealing the direction of information flow during allosteric modulation of its nucleotide-dependent intrinsic activity: active K-Ras Switch-II region motions drive Switch-I region motions, while $\alpha$-helix-3L7 motions control both. Our results provide novel insights for strategies that directly target mutant K-Ras.},

abstract = {The question of protein dynamics and its relevance to function is currently a topic of great interest. Proteins are particularly dynamic at the side-chain level on the time scale of picoseconds to nanoseconds. Here, we present a comparison of NMR-monitored side-chain motion between three PDZ domains of approximately 30% sequence identity and show that the side-chain dynamics display nontrivial conservation. Methyl (2)H relaxation was carried out to determine side-chain order parameters (S(2)), which were found to be more similar than naively expected from sequence, local packing, or a combination of the two. Thus, the dynamics of a rather distant homologue appears to be an excellent predictor of a protein's side-chain dynamics and, on average, better than current structure-based methods. Fast side-chain dynamics therefore display a high level of organization associated with global fold. Beyond simple conservation, the analysis herein suggests that the pattern of side-chain flexibility has significant contributions from nonlocal elements of the PDZ fold, such as correlated motions, and that the conserved dynamics may directly support function.},

Eventually, such sequences allow for the construction of reaction networks that are required for the kinetic analysis of chemical systems.

The manual extraction of valuable information from such reaction paths is straightforward but unfeasible for large and complex reaction networks. For real-time quantum chemistry, this implies automatization of the extraction and relaxation process while maintaining immersion in the virtual chemical environment. Here, we describe an efficient path processing scheme for the on-the-fly construction of an exploration network by approximating the explored paths as continuous basis-spline curves.},

abstract = {G-protein hetero-trimers play a fundamental role in cell function. Their dynamic behavior at the atomic level remains to be understood. We have studied the Gi hetero-trimer through a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and normal mode analyses. We showed that these big proteins could undergo large-amplitude conformational changes, without any energy penalty and with an intrinsic dynamics centered on their GDP binding pocket. Among the computed collective motions, one of the modes (mode 17) was particularly able to significantly open both the base and the phosphate sides of the GDP binding pocket. This mode describing mainly a motion between the Ras-like and the helical domains of G($\alpha$) was in close agreement with some available X-ray data and with many other biochemical/biophysical observations including the kink of helix $\alpha$5. The use of a new protocol, which allows extraction of the GDP ligand along the computed normal modes, supported that the exit of GDP was largely coupled to an opening motion along mode 17. We propose for the first time a "concerted mechanism" model in which the opening of the GDP pocket and the kink of the $\alpha$5 helix occur concomitantly and favor GDP release from G($\alpha$$\beta$$\gamma$) complexes. This model is discussed in the context of the G-protein-coupled receptor/G-protein interaction close to the cell membrane.},

Recent structures of GPCR-G protein complexes obtained by crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) reveal similar interactions between GPCRs and the alpha subunit of different G protein isoforms. While some G protein subtype-specific differences are observed, there is no clear structural explanation for G protein subtype-selectivity. All of these complexes are stabilized in the nucleotide-free state, a condition that does not exist in living cells. In an effort to better understand the structural basis of coupling specificity, we used time-resolved structural mass spectrometry techniques to investigate GPCR-G protein complex formation and G-protein activation. Our results suggest that coupling specificity is determined by one or more transient intermediate states that serve as selectivity filters and precede the formation of the stable nucleotide-free GPCR-G protein complexes observed in crystal and cryo-EM structures.},

abstract = {We show how to apply a general theoretical approach to nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, called Maximum Caliber, originally suggested by E. T. Jaynes [Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 31, 579 (1980)], to a problem of two-state dynamics. Maximum Caliber is a variational principle for dynamics in the same spirit that Maximum Entropy is a variational principle for equilibrium statistical mechanics. The central idea is to compute a dynamical partition function, a sum of weights over all microscopic paths, rather than over microstates. We illustrate the method on the simple problem of two-state dynamics, A<-->B, first for a single particle, then for M particles. Maximum Caliber gives a unified framework for deriving all the relevant dynamical properties, including the microtrajectories and all the moments of the time-dependent probability density. While it can readily be used to derive the traditional master equation and the Langevin results, it goes beyond them in also giving trajectory information. For example, we derive the Langevin noise distribution rather than assuming it. As a general approach to solving nonequilibrium statistical mechanics dynamical problems, Maximum Caliber has some advantages: (1) It is partition-function-based, so we can draw insights from similarities to equilibrium statistical mechanics.

abstract = {The function of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)-which represent the largest class of both human membrane proteins and drug targets-depends critically on their ability to change shape, transitioning among distinct conformations. Determining the structural dynamics of GPCRs is thus essential both for understanding the physiology of these receptors and for the rational design of GPCR-targeted drugs. Here we review what is currently known about the flexibility and dynamics of GPCRs, as determined through crystallography, spectroscopy, and computer simulations. We first provide an overview of the types of motion exhibited by a GPCR and then discuss GPCR dynamics in the context of ligand binding, activation, allosteric modulation, and biased signaling. Finally, we discuss the implications of GPCR conformational plasticity for drug design.},

abstract = {The configurational entropy of a protein is under physiological conditions a major contributor to the free energy. Its quantitative characterization is therefore an important step toward the understanding of protein function. The configurational entropy of the oncoprotein MDM2, whose determination is a challenge by experiment alone, is studied here by means of 0.4 $\mu$s molecular dynamics computer simulations in both the presence and absence of the p53-peptide ligand. By characterizing protein motions in dihedral angle space, it is found that the motional amplitudes change considerably upon ligand binding while correlations between dihedral angle motions are remarkably well conserved. This applies for backbone and side-chain dihedral angle pairs at both short- and long-range distance to the binding site. As a direct consequence, the change of the configurational entropy can be decomposed into a sum of local contributions. This significantly facilitates the understanding of the relationship between protein dynamics and thermodynamics, which is important, for example, in the context of protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions. The findings also have implications for the direct derivation of entropy changes from site-specific dynamics measurements as afforded by NMR spectroscopy.},

High-resolution x-ray structures of the GTP gamma S and GDP.AlF4- complexes formed by the G protein Gi alpha 1 demonstrate specific roles in transition-state stabilization for two highly conserved residues. Glutamine204 (Gln61 in p21ras) stabilizes and orients the hydrolytic water in the trigonal-bipyramidal transition state. Arginine 178 stabilizes the negative charge at the equatorial oxygen atoms of the pentacoordinate phosphate intermediate. Conserved only in the G alpha family, this residue may account for the higher hydrolytic rate of G alpha proteins relative to those of the p21ras family members. The fold of Gi alpha 1 differs from that of the homologous Gt alpha subunit in the conformation of a helix-loop sequence located in the alpha-helical domain that is characteristic of these proteins; this site may participate in effector binding. The amino-terminal 33 residues are disordered in GTP gamma S-Gi alpha 1, suggesting a mechanism that may promote release of the beta gamma subunit complex when the alpha subunit is activated by GTP.},

abstract = {Heterotrimeric G proteins are molecular switches that regulate numerous signaling pathways involved in cellular physiology. This characteristic is achieved by the adoption of two principal states: an inactive, GDP bound state and an active, GTP bound state. Under basal conditions, G proteins exist in the inactive, GDP bound state; thus, nucleotide exchange is crucial to the onset of signaling. Despite our understanding of G protein signaling pathways, the mechanism of nucleotide exchange remains elusive. We employed phage display technology to identify nucleotide state-dependent Galpha binding peptides. Herein, we report a GDP-selective Galpha binding peptide, KB-752, that enhances spontaneous nucleotide exchange of Galpha(i) subunits. Structural determination of the Galpha(i1)/peptide complex reveals unique changes in the Galpha switch regions predicted to enhance nucleotide exchange by creating a GDP dissociation route. Our results cast light onto a potential mechanism by which Galpha subunits adopt a conformation suitable for nucleotide exchange.},

abstract = {Liquids relax extremely slowly on approaching the glass state. One explanation is that an entropy crisis, because of the rarefaction of available states, makes it increasingly arduous to reach equilibrium in that regime. Validating this scenario is challenging, because experiments offer limited resolution, while numerical studies lag more than eight orders of magnitude behind experimentally relevant timescales. In this work, we not only close the colossal gap between experiments and simulations but manage to create in silico configurations that have no experimental analog yet. Deploying a range of computational tools, we obtain four estimates of their configurational entropy. These measurements consistently confirm that the steep entropy decrease observed in experiments is also found in simulations, even beyond the experimental glass transition. Our numerical results thus extend the observational window into the physics of glasses and reinforce the relevance of an entropy crisis for understanding their formation.},

Among these are changes in protein conformational entropy, which cannot yet be reliably computed from molecular structures. We have recently used changes in conformational dynamics as a proxy for changes in conformational entropy of calmodulin upon association with domains from regulated proteins. The apparent change in conformational entropy was linearly related to the overall binding entropy. This view warrants a more quantitative foundation. Here we calibrate an 'entropy meter' using an experimental dynamical proxy based on NMR relaxation and show that changes in the conformational entropy of calmodulin are a significant component of the energetics of binding. Furthermore, the distribution of motion at the interface between the target domain and calmodulin is surprisingly noncomplementary. These observations promote modification of our understanding of the energetics of protein-ligand interactions.},

abstract = {One of the greatest challenges in contemporary condensed matter physics is to ascertain whether the formation of glasses from liquids is fundamentally thermodynamic or dynamic in origin. Although the thermodynamic paradigm has dominated theoretical research for decades, the purely kinetic perspective of the dynamical facilitation (DF) theory has attained prominence in recent times. In particular, recent experiments and simulations have highlighted the importance of facilitation using simple model systems composed of spherical particles. However, an overwhelming majority of liquids possess anisotropy in particle shape and interactions, and it is therefore imperative to examine facilitation in complex glass formers. Here, we apply the DF theory to systems with orientational degrees of freedom as well as anisotropic attractive interactions. By analyzing data from experiments on colloidal ellipsoids, we show that facilitation plays a pivotal role in translational as well as orientational relaxation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the introduction of attractive interactions leads to spatial decoupling of translational and rotational facilitation, which subsequently results in the decoupling of dynamical heterogeneities. Most strikingly, the DF theory can predict the existence of reentrant glass transitions based on the statistics of localized dynamical events, called excitations, whose duration is substantially smaller than the structural relaxation time. Our findings pave the way for systematically testing the DF approach in complex glass formers and also establish the significance of facilitation in governing structural relaxation in supercooled liquids.},

abstract = {The biological activities of Rho family GTPases are controlled by their guanine nucleotide binding states in cells. Here we have investigated the role of Mg(2+) cofactor in the guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis processes of the Rho family members, Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA. Differing from Ras and Rab proteins, which require Mg(2+) for GDP and GTP binding, the Rho GTPases bind the nucleotides in the presence or absence of Mg(2+) similarly, with dissociation constants in the submicromolar concentration. The presence of Mg(2+), however, resulted in a marked decrease in the intrinsic dissociation rates of the nucleotides. The catalytic activity of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) appeared to be negatively regulated by free Mg(2+), and GEF binding to Rho GTPase resulted in a 10-fold decrease in affinity for Mg(2+), suggesting that one role of GEF is to displace bound Mg(2+) from the Rho proteins. The GDP dissociation rates of the GTPases could be further stimulated by GEF upon removal of bound Mg(2+), indicating that the GEF-catalyzed nucleotide exchange involves a Mg(2+)-independent as well as a Mg(2+)-dependent mechanism. Although Mg(2+) is not absolutely required for GTP hydrolysis by the Rho GTPases, the divalent ion apparently participates in the GTPase reaction, since the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rates were enhanced 4-10-fold upon binding to Mg(2+), and k(cat) values of the Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP)-catalyzed reactions were significantly increased when Mg(2+) was present. Furthermore, the p50RhoGAP specificity for Cdc42 was lost in the absence of Mg(2+) cofactor. These studies directly demonstrate a role of Mg(2+) in regulating the kinetics of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis and in the GEF- and GAP-catalyzed reactions of Rho family GTPases. The results suggest that GEF facilitates nucleotide exchange by destabilizing both bound nucleotide and Mg(2+), whereas RhoGAP utilizes the Mg(2+) cofactor to achieve high catalytic efficiency and specificity.},

abstract = {Solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) enables atomic-resolution characterization of the molecular structure and dynamics within complex heterogeneous samples, but it is typically insensitive. Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) increases the NMR signal intensity by orders of magnitude and can be performed in combination with magic angle spinning (MAS) for sensitive, high-resolution spectroscopy. Here we report MAS DNP experiments, for the first time, within intact human cells with >40-fold DNP enhancement and a sample temperature of <6 K. In addition to cryogenic MAS results at <6 K, we also show in-cell DNP enhancements of 57-fold at 90 K. In-cell DNP is demonstrated using biradicals and sterically shielded monoradicals as polarizing agents. A novel trimodal polarizing agent is introduced for DNP, which contains a nitroxide biradical, a targeting peptide for cell penetration, and a fluorophore for subcellular localization with confocal microscopy. The fluorescent polarizing agent provides in-cell DNP enhancements of 63-fold at a concentration of 2.7 mM. These experiments pave the way for structural characterization of biomolecules in an endogenous cellular context.},

abstract = {Allostery is an essential regulatory mechanism of biological function. Allosteric sites are also pharmacologically relevant as they are often targeted with higher selectivity than orthosteric sites. However, a comprehensive map of allosteric sites poses experimental challenges because allostery is driven not only by structural changes, but also by modulations in dynamics that typically remain elusive to classical structure determination methods. An avenue to overcome these challenges is provided by the NMR chemical shift covariance analysis (CHESCA), as chemical shifts are exquisitely sensitive to redistributions in dynamic conformational ensembles. Here, we propose a set of complementary CHESCA algorithms designed to reliably detect allosteric networks with minimal occurrences of false positives or negatives. The proposed CHESCA toolset was tested for two allosteric proteins (PKA and EPAC) and is expected to complement traditional comparative structural analyses in the comprehensive identification of functionally relevant allosteric sites, including those in otherwise elusive partially unstructured regions.},

We now show that overexpression of specific betagamma subunits can recover plasma membrane localization and palmitoylation of the betagamma-binding-deficient mutants of alpha(s) or alpha(q). Thus, the betagamma-binding-defective alpha is completely dependent on co-expression of exogenous betagamma for proper membrane localization. In this report, we examined the ability of beta(1-5) in combination with gamma(2) or gamma(3) to promote proper localization and palmitoylation of mutant alpha(s) or alpha(q). Immunofluorescence localization, cellular fractionation, and palmitate labeling revealed distinct subtype-specific differences in betagamma interactions with alpha subunits. These studies demonstrate that 1) alpha and betagamma reciprocally promote the plasma membrane targeting of the other subunit; 2) beta(5), when co-expressed with gamma(2) or gamma(3), fails to localize to the plasma membrane or promote plasma membrane localization of mutant alpha(s) or alpha(q); 3) beta(3) is deficient in promoting plasma membrane localization of mutant alpha(s) and alpha(q), whereas beta(4) is deficient in promoting plasma membrane localization of mutant alpha(q); 4) both palmitoylation and interactions with betagamma are required for plasma membrane localization of alpha.},

abstract = {Detailed understanding of how conformational dynamics orchestrates function in allosteric regulation of recognition and catalysis remains ambiguous. Here, we simulate CypA using multiple-microsecond-long atomistic molecular dynamics in explicit solvent and carry out NMR experiments. We analyze a large amount of time-dependent multidimensional data with a coarse-grained approach and map key dynamical features within individual macrostates by defining dynamics in terms of residue-residue contacts. The effects of substrate binding are observed to be largely sensed at a location over 15 {\AA} from the active site, implying its importance in allostery. Using NMR experiments, we confirm that a dynamic cluster of residues in this distal region is directly coupled to the active site. Furthermore, the dynamical network of interresidue contacts is found to be coupled and temporally dispersed, ranging over 4 to 5 orders of magnitude. Finally, using network centrality measures we demonstrate the changes in the communication network, connectivity, and influence of CypA residues upon substrate binding, mutation, and during catalysis. We identify key residues that potentially act as a bottleneck in the communication flow through the distinct regions in CypA and, therefore, as targets for future mutational studies. Mapping these dynamical features and the coupling of dynamics to function has crucial ramifications in understanding allosteric regulation in enzymes and proteins, in general.},

Here we exploit the recently developed multi-ensemble Markov model framework to compute full protein-peptide kinetics of the oncoprotein fragment (25-109)Mdm2 and the nano-molar inhibitor peptide PMI. Using this system, we report, for the first time, direct estimates of kinetics beyond the seconds timescale using simulations of an all-atom MD model, with high accuracy and precision. These results only require explicit simulations on the sub-milliseconds timescale and are tested against existing mutagenesis data and our own experimental measurements of the dissociation and association rates. The full kinetic model reveals an overall downhill but rugged binding funnel with multiple pathways. The overall strong binding arises from a variety of conformations with different hydrophobic contact surfaces that interconvert on the milliseconds timescale.},

abstract = {Chemical shift perturbation (CSP, chemical shift mapping or complexation-induced changes in chemical shift, CIS) follows changes in the chemical shifts of a protein when a ligand is added, and uses these to determine the location of the binding site, the affinity of the ligand, and/or possibly the structure of the complex. A key factor in determining the appearance of spectra during a titration is the exchange rate between free and bound, or more specifically the off-rate koff. When koff is greater than the chemical shift difference between free and bound, which typically equates to an affinity Kd weaker than about 3$\mu$M, then exchange is fast on the chemical shift timescale. Under these circumstances, the observed shift is the population-weighted average of free and bound, which allows Kd to be determined from measurement of peak positions, provided the measurements are made appropriately. (1)H shifts are influenced to a large extent by through-space interactions, whereas (13)C$\alpha$ and (13)C$\beta$ shifts are influenced more by through-bond effects. (15)N and (13)C' shifts are influenced both by through-bond and by through-space (hydrogen bonding) interactions. For determining the location of a bound ligand on the basis of shift change, the most appropriate method is therefore usually to measure (15)N HSQC spectra, calculate the geometrical distance moved by the peak, weighting (15)N shifts by a factor of about 0.14 compared to (1)H shifts, and select those residues for which the weighted shift change is larger than the standard deviation of the shift for all residues. Other methods are discussed, in particular the measurement of (13)CH3 signals. Slow to intermediate exchange rates lead to line broadening, and make Kd values very difficult to obtain. There is no good way to distinguish changes in chemical shift due to direct binding of the ligand from changes in chemical shift due to allosteric change. Ligand binding at multiple sites can often be characterised, by simultaneous fitting of many measured shift changes, or more simply by adding substoichiometric amounts of ligand. The chemical shift changes can be used as restraints for docking ligand onto protein. By use of quantitative calculations of ligand-induced chemical shift changes, it is becoming possible to determine not just the position but also the orientation of ligands.},

abstract = {Structural analysis of Gsalpha shows that it is composed of two domains: the ras-like domain (RD) that is conserved in all members of the GTPase superfamily and is homologous to the monomeric G-proteins (e.g., p21ras) and an alpha-helical domain (HD) that is unique to heterotrimeric G-proteins. Little is known about the function of the HD. Recent experiments by Bourne and co-workers, who expressed both the RD and the HD of Gsalpha separately and found that GTP hydrolysis is very slow if only recombinant RD is present but is accelerated when the HD is added, suggest that the HD serves as an intrinsic GTPase-activating protein (GAP). In this work, the GTP hydrolysis in Gsalpha was studied. The results obtained by calculating catalytic effects with and without the HD provide evidence for the role of the HD as a GAP. It is demonstrated that a major part of the catalysis is obtained because of an allosteric influence of the HD on the RD. Structural as well as energetic considerations suggest that the HD confines the RD to a more compact conformation, pushing the phosphate into an orientation where it is further stabilized, thus lowering the overall reaction barrier. The resemblance between the behavior of rasGAP and the HD suggests that the conclusion may be a general conclusion, applicable for all of the G-protein members.},

abstract = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are essential components of signalling networks throughout the body, and about a third of all clinical drugs target GPCRs. The X-ray structures of GPCRs in an active conformation have proved elusive. This paper describes the crystal structure of adenosine A2A receptor bound to a G protein, which represents the first X-ray structure of the fully active state of the receptor. The trick used here involved engineering a G protein termed mini-Gs that binds to and stabilizes the active state of the adenosine A2A receptor. The hope is that this mini-Gs will facilitate the crystallization and characterization of other Gs-coupled GPCRs in their active states.},

abstract = {Pentamers of the L1 major capsid protein of human papillomavirus (HPV type 11) were purified after expression in E. coli and analyzed for the kinetics of in vitro capsid self-assembly using multi-angle light scattering (MALS). Pentamers self-assembled into capsid-like structures at a rate that was a function of protein concentration. The kinetics of capsid formation were sigmoidal with a concentration-dependent lag phase, followed by a rapid increase in polymerization. Nucleation size and the rate order of subsequent subunit addition were calculated from the concentration dependence of the extent of capsid formation and the rate of the fast phase, respectively. Assembly was second order with a nucleation size of two pentamers. Thus, we suggest that dimers of pentamers are the nucleus for L1 assembly into capsid-like structures, with rapid sequential addition of single pentamers to the growing shell. Although studied in vitro without accessory factors that may be present in vivo, these data are in contrast with the "five-around-one" assembly nucleus previously proposed for polyomaviruses.},

abstract = {The biological activities of Rho family GTPases are controlled by their guanine nucleotide binding states in cells. Here we have investigated the role of Mg(2+) cofactor in the guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis processes of the Rho family members, Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA. Differing from Ras and Rab proteins, which require Mg(2+) for GDP and GTP binding, the Rho GTPases bind the nucleotides in the presence or absence of Mg(2+) similarly, with dissociation constants in the submicromolar concentration. The presence of Mg(2+), however, resulted in a marked decrease in the intrinsic dissociation rates of the nucleotides. The catalytic activity of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) appeared to be negatively regulated by free Mg(2+), and GEF binding to Rho GTPase resulted in a 10-fold decrease in affinity for Mg(2+), suggesting that one role of GEF is to displace bound Mg(2+) from the Rho proteins. The GDP dissociation rates of the GTPases could be further stimulated by GEF upon removal of bound Mg(2+), indicating that the GEF-catalyzed nucleotide exchange involves a Mg(2+)-independent as well as a Mg(2+)-dependent mechanism. Although Mg(2+) is not absolutely required for GTP hydrolysis by the Rho GTPases, the divalent ion apparently participates in the GTPase reaction, since the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rates were enhanced 4-10-fold upon binding to Mg(2+), and k(cat) values of the Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP)-catalyzed reactions were significantly increased when Mg(2+) was present. Furthermore, the p50RhoGAP specificity for Cdc42 was lost in the absence of Mg(2+) cofactor. These studies directly demonstrate a role of Mg(2+) in regulating the kinetics of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis and in the GEF- and GAP-catalyzed reactions of Rho family GTPases. The results suggest that GEF facilitates nucleotide exchange by destabilizing both bound nucleotide and Mg(2+), whereas RhoGAP utilizes the Mg(2+) cofactor to achieve high catalytic efficiency and specificity.},

abstract = {Structure-function relationships in proteins are predicated on the spatial proximity of noncovalently interacting groups of atoms. Thus, structural elements located away from a protein's active site are typically presumed to serve a stabilizing or scaffolding role for the larger structure. Here we report a functional role for a distal structural element in a PDZ domain, even though it is not required to maintain PDZ structure. The third PDZ domain from PSD-95/SAP90 (PDZ3) has an unusual additional third alpha helix (alpha3) that packs in contiguous fashion against the globular domain. Although alpha3 lies outside the active site and does not make direct contact with C-terminal peptide ligand, removal of alpha3 reduces ligand affinity by 21-fold. Further investigation revealed that the difference in binding free energies between the full-length and truncated constructs is predominantly entropic in nature and that without alpha3, picosecond-nanosecond side-chain dynamics are enhanced throughout the domain, as determined by (2)H methyl NMR relaxation. Thus, the distal modulation of binding function appears to occur via a delocalized conformational entropy mechanism. Without removal of alpha3 and characterization of side-chain dynamics, this dynamic allostery would have gone unnoticed. Moreover, what appeared at first to be an artificial modification of PDZ3 has been corroborated by experimentally verified phosphorylation of alpha3, revealing a tangible biological mechanism for this novel regulatory scheme. This hidden dynamic allostery raises the possibility of as-yet unidentified or untapped allosteric regulation in this PDZ domain and is a very clear example of function arising from dynamics rather than from structure.},

Compared to inactive A1R, there is contraction at the extracellular surface in the orthosteric binding site mediated via movement of transmembrane domains 1 and 2. At the intracellular surface, the G protein engages the A1R primarily via amino acids in the C terminus of the G$\alpha$i $\alpha$5-helix, concomitant with a 10.5~{\AA} outward movement of the A1R transmembrane domain 6. Comparison with the agonist-bound $\beta$2 adrenergic receptor-Gs-protein complex reveals distinct orientations for each G-protein subtype upon engagement with its receptor. This active A1R structure provides molecular insights into receptor and G-protein selectivity.},

abstract = {X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) refers to the details of how X-rays are absorbed by an atom at energies near and above the core-level binding energies of that particular atom. The absorption of X-rays on the high energy side of absorption edges does not vary monotonically in condensed matter but has a complicated behavior which extends past the edge up to about {\textasciitilde}1 keV. This non-monotonic variation has received the name of X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS). The X-ray absorption fine structure is typically divided into two regimes: X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). This review describes the basic phenomenon of XAFS, theory of EXAFS and the method of extracting structural parameters by EXAFS which relate to the local environment surrounding the absorbing atom. Also, it has been pointed out that XANES can be used to extract information about the oxidation state, three dimensional geometry, and coordination environment of elements under investigation. There are numerous examples of the applications of the XAFS in various fields in the literature. Some selected examples are cited here and discussed so as to give the reader a glimpse of the usefulness and versatility of the XAFS. The two types of EXAFS beamlines available at the synchrotron facilities have been described. The details of BL-8 dispersive EXAFS beamline at 2 GeV Indus-2 synchrotron source at Raja Ramanna Center for Advanced Technology (RRCAT), Indore, India have been given. For the last fifty years research workers in India have been doing XAFS experiments on laboratory set-ups. Now, it is hoped that research workers from Indian laboratories will do experiments on synchrotrons. Hence, details regarding experiment and analysis of the XAFS data have been given in this review so that any one who wants to do research work in the field of XAFS may get necessary information at one place. This is important because the EXAFS beamlines at the Indus-2 synchrotron have become easily available to Indian workers which were not available until now.},

abstract = {Stimulation of beta2-adrenergic receptors on the cell surface by adrenaline or noradrenaline leads to alterations in the metabolism, excitability, differentiation and growth of many cell types. These effects have traditionally been thought to be mediated exclusively by receptor activation of intracellular G proteins. However, certain physiological effects of beta2-adrenergic receptor stimulation, notably the regulation of cellular pH by modulation of Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) function, do not seem to be entirely dependent on G-protein activation. We report here a direct agonist-promoted association of the beta2-adrenergic receptor with the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF), a protein that regulates the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger type 3 (NHE3). NHERF binds to the beta2-adrenergic receptor by means of a PDZ-domain-mediated interaction with the last few residues of the carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. Mutation of the final residue of the beta2-adrenergic receptor from leucine to alanine abolishes the receptor's interaction with NHERF and also markedly alters beta2-adrenergic receptor regulation of NHE3 in cells without altering receptor-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase. Our findings indicate that agonist-dependent beta2-adrenergic receptor binding of NHERF plays a role in beta2-adrenergic receptor-mediated regulation of Na+/H+ exchange.},

abstract = {Recent advances in simulation and experiment have led to dramatic increases in the quantity and complexity of produced data, which makes the development of automated analysis tools very important. A powerful approach to analyze dynamics contained in such data sets is to describe/approximate it by diffusion on a free energy landscape - free energy as a function of reaction coordinates (RC). For the description to be quantitatively accurate, RCs should be chosen in an optimal way. Recent theoretical results show that such an optimal RC exists; however, determining it for practical systems is a very difficult unsolved problem. Here we describe a solution to this problem. We describe an adaptive nonparametric approach to accurately determine the optimal RC (the committor) for an equilibrium trajectory of a realistic system. In contrast to alternative approaches, which require a functional form with many parameters to approximate an RC and thus extensive expertise with the system, the suggested approach is nonparametric and can approximate any RC with high accuracy without system specific information. To avoid overfitting for a realistically sampled system, the approach performs RC optimization in an adaptive manner by focusing optimization on less optimized spatiotemporal regions of the RC. The power of the approach is illustrated on a long equilibrium atomistic folding simulation of HP35 protein. We have determined the optimal folding RC - the committor, which was confirmed by passing a stringent committor validation test. It allowed us to determine a first quantitatively accurate protein folding free energy landscape. We have confirmed the recent theoretical results that diffusion on such a free energy profile can be used to compute exactly the equilibrium flux, the mean first passage times, and the mean transition path times between any two points on the profile. We have shown that the mean squared displacement along the optimal RC grows linear with time as for simple diffusion. The free energy profile allowed us to obtain a direct rigorous estimate of the pre-exponential factor for the folding dynamics.},

abstract = {ConspectusThis Account highlights recent advances and discusses major challenges in investigations of cryptic (hidden) binding sites by molecular simulations. Cryptic binding sites are not visible in protein targets crystallized without a ligand and only become visible crystallographically upon binding events. These sites have been shown to be druggable and might provide a rare opportunity to target difficult proteins. However, due to their hidden nature, they are difficult to find through experimental screening. Computational methods based on atomistic molecular simulations remain one of the best approaches to identify and characterize cryptic binding sites. However, not all methods are equally efficient. Some are more apt at quickly probing protein dynamics but do not provide thermodynamic or druggability information, while others that are able to provide such data are demanding in terms of time and resources. Here, we review the recent contributions of mixed-solvent simulations, metadynamics, Markov state models, and other enhanced sampling methods to the field of cryptic site identification and characterization. We discuss how these methods were able to provide precious information on the nature of the site opening mechanisms, to predict previously unknown sites which were used to design new ligands, and to compute the free energy landscapes and kinetics associated with the opening of the sites and the binding of the ligands. We highlight the potential and the importance of such predictions in drug discovery, especially for difficult ("undruggable") targets. We also discuss the major challenges in the field and their possible solutions.},

abstract = {Correlated motions in biomolecules are often essential for their function, e.g., allosteric signal transduction or mechanical/thermodynamic energy transport. Because correlated motions in biomolecules remain difficult to access experimentally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are particular useful for their analysis. The established method to quantify correlations from MD simulations via calculation of the covariance matrix, however, is restricted to linear correlations and therefore misses part of the correlations in the atomic fluctuations. Herein, we propose a general statistical mechanics approach to detect and quantify any correlated motion from MD trajectories. This generalized correlation measure is contrasted with correlations obtained from covariance matrices for the B1 domain of protein G and T4 lysozyme. The new method successfully quantifies correlations and provides a valuable global overview over the functionally relevant collective motions of lysozyme. In particular, correlated motions of helix 1 together with the two main lobes of lysozyme are detected, which are not seen by the conventional covariance matrix. Overall, the established method misses more than 50% of the correlation. This failure is attributed to both, an interfering and unnecessary dependence on mutual orientations of the atomic fluctuations and, to a lesser extent, attributed to nonlinear correlations. Our generalized correlation measure overcomes these problems and, moreover, allows for an improved understanding of the conformational dynamics by separating linear and nonlinear contributions of the correlation.},

abstract = {RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is an essential enzyme that catalyzes transcription with high efficiency and fidelity in eukaryotic cells. During transcription elongation, Pol II catalyzes the nucleotide addition cycle (NAC) to synthesize mRNA using DNA as the template. The transitions between the states of the NAC require conformational changes of both the protein and nucleotides. Although X-ray structures are available for most of these states, the dynamics of the transitions between states are largely unknown. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can predict structure-based molecular details and shed light on the mechanisms of these dynamic transitions. However, the employment of MD simulations on a macromolecule (tens to hundreds of nanoseconds) such as Pol II is challenging due to the difficulty of reaching biologically relevant timescales (tens of microseconds or even longer). For this challenge to be overcome, kinetic network models (KNMs), such as Markov State Models (MSMs), have become a popular approach to access long-timescale conformational changes using many short MD simulations. We describe here our application of KNMs to characterize the molecular mechanisms of the NAC of Pol II. First, we introduce the general background of MSMs and further explain procedures for the construction and validation of MSMs by providing some technical details. Next, we review our previous studies in which we applied MSMs to investigate the individual steps of the NAC, including translocation and pyrophosphate ion release. In particular, we describe in detail how we prepared the initial conformations of Pol II elongation complex, performed MD simulations, extracted MD conformations to construct MSMs, and further validated them. We also summarize our major findings on molecular mechanisms of Pol II elongation based on these MSMs. In addition, we have included discussions regarding various key points and challenges for applications of MSMs to systems as large as the Pol II elongation complex. Finally, to study the overall NAC, we combine the individual steps of the NAC into a five-state KNM based on a nonbranched Brownian ratchet scheme to explain the single-molecule optical tweezers experimental data. The studies complement experimental observations and provide molecular mechanisms for the transcription elongation cycle. In the long term, incorporation of sequence-dependent kinetic parameters into KNMs has great potential for identifying error-prone sequences and predicting transcription dynamics in genome-wide transcriptomes. },

Complexity in the configurational free-energy landscape of the macromolecule leads to a renormalization of the internal modes, while the global modes provide a basis set in which the dipolar orientation and global anisotropy can be accounted for when comparing to experiments.

The aerobic degradation of PAH via oxygenase reactions has been studied for several decades. In contrast, it was not until very recent that the first key enzyme involved in anaerobic PAH degradation, the dearomatizing 2-naphthoyl-CoA reductase, was isolated and characterized. In this work, a PCR-based functional assay was developed to detect microorganisms that have the ability to anaerobically degrade naphthalene, as a model for larger PAH. The degenerative oligonucleotide probes introduced here amplified a highly conserved region of the gene encoding 2-naphthoyl-CoA reductase (Ncr) in numerous sulfate-reducing pure cultures and environmental enrichments. The assay provides the first molecular tool for monitoring the anaerobic degradation of a model PAH.},

abstract = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate multiple signaling pathways in the cell depending on the agonist that activates the receptor and multiple cellular factors. Agonists that show higher potency to specific signaling pathways over others are known as "biased agonists" and have been shown to have better therapeutic index. Although biased agonists are desirable, their design poses several challenges to date. The number of assays to identify biased agonists seems expensive and tedious. Therefore, computational methods that can reliably calculate the possible bias of various ligands ahead of experiments and provide guidance will be both cost and time effective. In this work, using the mechanism of allosteric communication from the extracellular region to the intracellular transducer protein coupling region in GPCRs, we have developed a computational method, to calculate ligand bias ahead of experiments. We have validated the method for several $\beta$-arrestin biased agonists in $\beta$2-adrenergic receptor, serotonin receptors 5HT1B and 5HT2B and for G-protein biased agonists in the $\kappa$-opioid receptor. Using this computational method, we also performed a blind prediction followed by experimental testing and showed that the agonist carmoterol is $\beta$-arrestin biased in $\beta$2-adrenergic receptor. Additionally, we have identified amino acid residues in the biased agonist binding site in both $\beta$2-adrenergic and $\kappa$-opioid receptors that are involved in potentiating the ligand bias. We call these residues as "functional hotspots" and they can be used to derive pharmacophores to design biased agonists in GPCRs.},

It remains unclear how binding of diverse ligands brings about GPCR activation, the common structural change that enables intracellular signaling. Here, we identify highly conserved networks of water-mediated interactions that play a central role in activation. Using atomic-level simulations of diverse GPCRs, we show that most of the water molecules in GPCR crystal structures are highly mobile. Several water molecules near the G protein-coupling interface, however, are stable. These water molecules form two kinds of polar networks that are conserved across diverse GPCRs: (i) a network that is maintained across the inactive and the active states and (ii) a network that rearranges upon activation. Comparative analysis of GPCR crystal structures independently confirms the striking conservation of water-mediated interaction networks. These conserved water-mediated interactions near the G protein-coupling region, along with diverse water-mediated interactions with extracellular ligands, have direct implications for structure-based drug design and GPCR engineering.},

We find that an isolated monomer is mainly disordered with a short $\alpha$-helix formed at the central hydrophobic core region (L17-D23). A less stable hairpin structure, however, becomes increasingly more stable in oligomers, where hydrogen bonds can form between neighboring monomers. We explore the structure and stability of both prefibrillar oligomers that consist of mainly antiparallel $\beta$-sheets and fibrillar oligomers with only parallel $\beta$-sheets. Prefibrillar oligomers are polymorphic but typically take on a cylindrin-like shape composed of mostly antiparallel $\beta$-strands. At the concentration of the simulation, the aggregation free energy landscape is nearly downhill. We use umbrella sampling along a structural progress coordinate for interconversion between prefibrillar and fibrillar forms to identify a conversion pathway between these forms. The fibrillar oligomer only becomes favored over its prefibrillar counterpart in the pentamer where an interconversion bottleneck appears. The structural characterization of the pathway along with statistical mechanical perturbation theory allow us to evaluate the effects of concentration on the free energy landscape of aggregation as well as the effects of the Dutch and Arctic mutations associated with early onset of Alzheimer's disease.},

Here we show that perturbations in equilibrium picosecond-nanosecond motions impact zinc (Zn)-induced allosteric inhibition of DNA binding by the Zn efflux repressor CzrA (chromosomal zinc-regulated repressor). DNA binding leads to an unanticipated increase in methyl side-chain flexibility and thus stabilizes the complex entropically; Zn binding redistributes these motions, inhibiting formation of the DNA complex by restricting coupled fast motions and concerted slower motions. Allosterically impaired CzrA mutants are characterized by distinct nonnative fast internal dynamics "fingerprints" upon Zn binding, and DNA binding is weakly regulated. We demonstrate the predictive power of the wild-type dynamics fingerprint to identify key residues in dynamics-driven allostery. We propose that driving forces arising from dynamics can be harnessed by nature to evolve new allosteric ligand specificities in a compact molecular scaffold.},

abstract = {Mechanotransduction plays a crucial role in vascular biology. One example of this is the local regulation of~vascular resistance via flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Impairment of this process is a hallmark of endothelial dysfunction and a precursor to a wide array of vascular diseases, such as hypertension and atherosclerosis. Yet the molecules responsible for sensing flow (shear stress) within endothelial cells remain largely unknown. We designed a 384-well screening system that applies shear stress on cultured cells. We identified a mechanosensitive cell line that exhibits shear stress-activated calcium transients, screened a focused RNAi library, and identified GPR68 as necessary and sufficient for shear stress responses. GPR68 is expressed in endothelial cells of small-diameter (resistance) arteries. Importantly, Gpr68-deficient mice display markedly impaired acute FMD and chronic flow-mediated outward remodeling in mesenteric arterioles. Therefore, GPR68 is an essential flow sensor in arteriolar endothelium and is a critical signaling component in cardiovascular pathophysiology.},

abstract = {Allosteric (i.e. long-range) communication within proteins is crucial for many biological processes, such as the activation of signaling cascades in response to specific stimuli. However, the physical basis for this communication remains unclear. Existing computational methods for identifying allostery focus on the role of concerted structural changes, but recent experimental work demonstrates that disorder is also an important factor. Here, we introduce the Correlation of All Rotameric and Dynamical States (CARDS) framework for quantifying correlations between both the structure and disorder of different regions of a protein. To quantify disorder, we draw inspiration from methods for quantifying "dynamic heterogeneity" from chemical physics to classify segments of a dihedral's time evolution as being in either ordered or disordered regimes. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we apply CARDS to the Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP), a transcriptional activator that is regulated by Cyclic Adenosine MonoPhosphate (cAMP) binding. We find that CARDS captures allosteric communication between the two cAMP-Binding Domains (CBDs) that NMR experiments have established occurs without a concerted structural change. CARDS also recapitulates an enhanced role for disorder in the communication between the DNA-Binding Domains (DBDs) and CBDs in the S62F variant of CAP. Finally, we demonstrate that using CARDS to find communication hotspots automatically identifies regions of CAP that are in allosteric communication without foreknowledge of their identities. Therefore, we expect CARDS to be of great utility for both understanding and predicting allostery.},

abstract = {We construct coarse master equations for peptide folding dynamics from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. A maximum-likelihood propagator-based method allows us to extract accurate rates for the transitions between the different conformational states of the small helix-forming peptide Ala5. Assigning the conformational states by using transition paths instead of instantaneous molecular coordinates suppresses the effects of fast non-Markovian dynamics. The resulting master equations are validated by comparing their analytical correlation functions with those obtained directly from the molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the master equations properly capture the character and relaxation times of the entire spectrum of conformational relaxation processes. By using the eigenvectors of the transition rate matrix, we are able to systematically coarse-grain the system. We find that a two-state description, with a folded and an unfolded state, roughly captures the slow conformational dynamics. A four-state model, with two folded and two unfolded states, accurately recovers the three slowest relaxation process with time scales between 1.5 and 7 ns. The master equation models not only give access to the slow conformational dynamics but also shed light on the molecular mechanisms of the helix-coil transition.},

While many aspects of GPCR signaling have been uncovered through decades of studies, some fundamental properties, like its channel capacity-a measure of how much information a given transmission system can reliably transduce-are still debated. Previous studies concluded that GPCRs in individual cells could transmit around one bit of information about the concentration of the ligands, allowing only for a reliable on or off response. Using muscarinic receptor-induced calcium response measured in individual cells upon repeated stimulation, we show that GPCR signaling systems possess a significantly higher capacity. We estimate the channel capacity of this system to be above two, implying that at least four concentration levels of the agonist can be distinguished reliably. These findings shed light on the basic principles of GPCR signaling.},

A percolation phase transition occurs when, as edges are added to a network, its largest connected cluster abruptly jumps from insignificance to complete dominance. In this article, we apply percolation theory to meticulously constructed networks of protein folding dynamics called Markov state models. As rare fluctuations are systematically repressed (or reintroduced), we observe percolation-like phase transitions in protein folding networks: whole sets of conformational states switch from nearly complete isolation to complete connectivity in a rapid fashion. We analyze the general and critical properties of these phase transitions in seven protein systems and discuss how closely dynamics on protein folding landscapes relate to percolation on random lattices.},

Amino acid substitutions in the conserved alpha5 helix of G(i), which extends from the C-terminal region to the nucleotide-binding pocket, cause dramatic increases in basal (receptor-independent) GDP release rates. For example, mutant Galpha(i1)-T329A shows an 18-fold increase in basal GDP release rate and, when expressed in culture, it causes a significant decrease in forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. The crystal structure of Galpha(i1)-T329A.GDP shows substantial conformational rearrangement of the switch I region and additional striking alterations of side chains lining the catalytic pocket that disrupt the Mg(+2) coordination sphere and dislodge bound Mg(+2). We propose a "sequential release" mechanism whereby a transient conformational change in the alpha5 helix alters switch I to induce GDP release. Interestingly, this mechanistic model for heterotrimeric G protein activation is similar to that suggested for the activation of the plant small G protein Rop4 by RopGEF8.},

This equation cannot be solved in general but we present several approximations that are valid either in the low temperature regime or in the presence of barrier crossing. We show that this method warrants the generation of statistically independent transition paths. It is computationally very efficient. We illustrate the method first on two simple potentials, the two-dimensional Mueller potential and the Mexican hat potential, and then on the multi-dimensional problem of conformational transitions in proteins using the "Mixed Elastic Network Model" as a benchmark.},

abstract = {Many regulatory proteins bind peptide regions of target proteins and modulate their activity. Such regulatory proteins can often interact with highly diverse target peptides. In many instances, it is not known if the peptide-binding interface discriminates targets in a biological context, or whether biological specificity is achieved exclusively through external factors such as subcellular localization. We used an evolutionary biochemical approach to distinguish these possibilities for two such low-specificity proteins: S100A5 and S100A6. We used isothermal titration calorimetry to study the binding of peptides with diverse sequence and biochemistry to human S100A5 and S100A6. These proteins bound distinct, but overlapping, sets of peptide targets. We then studied the peptide binding properties of orthologs sampled from across five amniote species. Binding specificity was conserved along all lineages, for the last 320 million years, despite the low specificity of each protein. We used ancestral sequence reconstruction to determine the binding specificity of the last common ancestor of the paralogs. The ancestor bound the entire set of peptides bound by modern S100A5 and S100A6 proteins, suggesting that paralog specificity evolved via subfunctionalization. To rule out the possibility that specificity is conserved because it is difficult to modify, we identified a single historical mutation that, when reverted in human S100A5, gave it the ability to bind an S100A6-specific peptide. These results reveal strong evolutionary constraints on peptide binding specificity. Despite being able to bind a large number of targets, the specificity of S100 peptide interfaces is likely important for the biology of these proteins.},

abstract = {For many patients with cardiac insufficiency, the disease progresses inexorably to organ dilatation, pump failure, and death. Although there are examples of reversible heart failure in man, our understanding of how the myocardium repairs itself is limited. A well defined animal model of reversible heart failure would allow us to better investigate these restorative processes. Receptors that activate Galpha(q), a signal transduction molecule in the heterotrimeric G protein superfamily, are thought to play a key role in the development of heart failure. We demonstrated previously that mice expressing a recombinant Galpha(q) protein, the activity of which can be turned on or off at will in cardiac myocytes, develop a dilated cardiomyopathy with generalized edema and heart failure following activation of the protein (Fan, G., Jiang, Y.-P., Lu, Z., Martin, D. W., Kelly, D. J., Zuckerman, J. M., Ballou, L. M., Cohen, I. S., and Lin, R. Z. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 40337-40346). Here we report that the contractile dysfunction and pathological structural changes in the myocardium improved significantly after termination of the Galpha(q) signal, even in animals with overt heart failure. Abnormalities in two proteins that regulate Ca(2+) handling in myocytes, phospholamban and the voltage-dependent L-type Ca(2+) channel, were also reversed, as was the increased expression of genes that are associated with heart failure. These results indicate that the heart has a substantial reparative capacity if the molecular signals responsible for the myocardial dysfunction can be identified and blocked.},

Although protein motions have clear implications for ligand flux, a role for dynamics in the chemical step of enzyme catalysis has not been clearly established. We generated a mutant of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase that abrogates millisecond-time-scale fluctuations in the enzyme active site without perturbing its structural and electrostatic preorganization. This dynamic knockout severely impairs hydride transfer. Thus, we have found a link between conformational fluctuations on the millisecond time scale and the chemical step of an enzymatic reaction, with broad implications for our understanding of enzyme mechanisms and for design of novel protein catalysts.},

abstract = {The RNA polymerase II elongation is central in eukaryotic transcription. Although multiple intermediates of the elongation complex have been identified, the dynamical mechanisms remain elusive or controversial. Here we build a structure-based kinetic model of a full elongation cycle of polymerase II, taking into account transition rates and conformational changes characterized from both single molecule experimental studies and computational simulations at atomistic scale. Our model suggests a force-dependent slow transition detected in the single molecule experiments corresponds to an essential conformational change of a trigger loop (TL) opening prior to the polymerase translocation. The analyses on mutant study of E1103G and on potential sequence effects of the translocation substantiate this proposal. Our model also investigates another slow transition detected in the transcription elongation cycle which is independent of mechanical force. If this force-independent slow transition happens as the TL gradually closes upon NTP binding, the analyses indicate that the binding affinity of NTP to the polymerase has to be sufficiently high. Otherwise, one infers that the slow transition happens pre-catalytically but after the TL closing. Accordingly, accurate determination of intrinsic properties of NTP binding is demanded for an improved characterization of the polymerase elongation. Overall, the study provides a working model of the polymerase II elongation under a generic Brownian ratchet mechanism, with most essential structural transition and functional kinetics elucidated.},

The local-global approach does not require an initial guess to the path, a major challenge for global pathway finders.

abstract = {Chemical shift perturbation (CSP, chemical shift mapping or complexation-induced changes in chemical shift, CIS) follows changes in the chemical shifts of a protein when a ligand is added, and uses these to determine the location of the binding site, the affinity of the ligand, and/or possibly the structure of the complex. A key factor in determining the appearance of spectra during a titration is the exchange rate between free and bound, or more specifically the off-rate koff. When koff is greater than the chemical shift difference between free and bound, which typically equates to an affinity Kd weaker than about 3$\mu$M, then exchange is fast on the chemical shift timescale. Under these circumstances, the observed shift is the population-weighted average of free and bound, which allows Kd to be determined from measurement of peak positions, provided the measurements are made appropriately. (1)H shifts are influenced to a large extent by through-space interactions, whereas (13)C$\alpha$ and (13)C$\beta$ shifts are influenced more by through-bond effects. (15)N and (13)C' shifts are influenced both by through-bond and by through-space (hydrogen bonding) interactions. For determining the location of a bound ligand on the basis of shift change, the most appropriate method is therefore usually to measure (15)N HSQC spectra, calculate the geometrical distance moved by the peak, weighting (15)N shifts by a factor of about 0.14 compared to (1)H shifts, and select those residues for which the weighted shift change is larger than the standard deviation of the shift for all residues. Other methods are discussed, in particular the measurement of (13)CH3 signals. Slow to intermediate exchange rates lead to line broadening, and make Kd values very difficult to obtain. There is no good way to distinguish changes in chemical shift due to direct binding of the ligand from changes in chemical shift due to allosteric change. Ligand binding at multiple sites can often be characterised, by simultaneous fitting of many measured shift changes, or more simply by adding substoichiometric amounts of ligand. The chemical shift changes can be used as restraints for docking ligand onto protein. By use of quantitative calculations of ligand-induced chemical shift changes, it is becoming possible to determine not just the position but also the orientation of ligands.},

abstract = {Metadynamics is an atomistic simulation technique that allows, within the same framework, acceleration of rare events and estimation of the free energy of complex molecular systems. It is based on iteratively {\textquoteleft}filling{\textquoteright} the potential energy of the system by a sum of Gaussians centred along the trajectory followed by a suitably chosen set of collective variables (CVs), thereby forcing the system to migrate from one minimum to the next. The power of metadynamics is demonstrated by the large number of extensions and variants that have been developed. The first scope of this Technical Review is to present a critical comparison of these variants, discussing their advantages and disadvantages. The effectiveness of metadynamics, and that of the numerous alternative methods, is strongly influenced by the choice of the CVs. If an important variable is neglected, the resulting estimate of the free energy is unreliable, and predicted transition mechanisms may be qualitatively wrong. The second scope of this Technical Review is to discuss how the CVs should be selected, how to verify whether the chosen CVs are sufficient or redundant, and how to iteratively improve the CVs using machine learning approaches. Metadynamics is a technique to enhance the probability of observing rare events, such as chemical reactions and phase transitions, in molecular dynamics simulations. This Technical Review surveys the technique, addressing the critical issues that are met in practical applications.},

Qi et al. determined the structure of bovine membrane AC9 bound to an activated G protein $\alpha$s subunit by cryo{\textendash}electron microscopy at 3.4-angstrom resolution. The structure provides the full architecture of AC9, including a helical domain that connects the transmembrane and catalytic domains. The model reveals how the domains interact to regulate enzymatic activity, including suggesting a mechanism of self-inhibition. Science , this issue p. [389][1] Membrane-integral adenylyl cyclases (ACs) are key enzymes in mammalian heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein){\textendash}dependent signal transduction, which is important in many cellular processes. Signals received by the G protein{\textendash}coupled receptors are conveyed to ACs through G proteins to modulate the levels of cellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Here, we describe the cryo{\textendash}electron microscopy structure of the bovine membrane AC9 bound to an activated G protein $\alpha$s subunit at 3.4-angstrom resolution. The structure reveals the organization of the membrane domain and helical domain that spans between the membrane and catalytic domains of AC9. The carboxyl-terminal extension of the catalytic domain occludes both the catalytic and the allosteric sites of AC9, inducing a conformation distinct from the substrate- and activator-bound state, suggesting a regulatory role in cAMP production.

In this review, using systems for which atomistic simulations have been carried out in our groups as examples, we describe the current understanding of allostery, how the mechanisms go beyond the classical MWC/Pauling-KNF descriptions, and point out that the "new view" of allostery, emphasizing "population shifts," is, in fact, an "old view."

abstract = {Author Summary The Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP) is a well-studied example for how cellular catabolite levels are integrated into the gene regulation. Its affinity for a specific stretch of DNA can be switched on by the binding of two nucleotide molecules termed cAMP to its two protomers. Even though the nucleotides occupy structurally identical binding pockets, the second cAMP binding occurs at an affinity orders of magnitude lower than the first cAMP binding. The question arises how, in the absence of structural changes, the first binding can affect the second. An answer from experiments has been that the communication is largely of entropic nature, i.e. the second cAMP binding would lead to a pronounced reduction in atomic fluctuations of the protein without affecting the atomic mean positions. We here revisited this question by performing Molecular Dynamics simulations. By measuring correlations of forces, a newly derived method outperforming the more common coordinate-based approach, we could recover the previously determined entropic penalty. In addition, however, we observed unobtrusive structural changes of side-chain interactions leading to the occlusion of the second binding pocket that add a critical {\textquoteleft}enthalpic{\textquoteright} component hitherto overlooked. Our study provides a mechanistic view onto the intriguing anti-cooperativity of CAP.},

Based upon a statistical mechanics of trajectory space, they provide a perspective with which time dependent phenomena, even for systems driven far from equilibrium, can be examined with the same types of importance sampling tools that in the past have been applied so successfully to static equilibrium properties.},

abstract = {Heterotrimeric G proteins are the core upstream elements that transduce and amplify the cellular signals from G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to intracellular effectors. GPCRs are the largest family of membrane proteins encoded in the human genome and are the targets of about one third of prescription medicines. However, to date, no single therapeutic agent exerts its effects via perturbing heterotrimeric G protein function, despite a plethora of evidence linking G protein malfunction to human disease. Several recent studies have brought to light that the Gq family-specific inhibitor FR900359 (FR) is unexpectedly efficacious in silencing the signaling of Gq oncoproteins, mutant Gq variants that mostly exist in the active state. These data not only raise the hope that researchers working in drug discovery may be able to potentially strike Gq oncoproteins from the list of undruggable targets, but also raise questions as to how FR achieves its therapeutic effect. Here we place emphasis on these recent studies and explain why they expand our pharmacological armamentarium for targeting Gq protein oncogenes as well as broaden our mechanistic understanding of Gq protein oncogene function. We also highlight how this novel insight impacts the significance and utility of using~G(q) proteins as targets in drug discovery efforts.},

abstract = {The abundance of Geobacter species in contaminated aquifers in which benzene is anaerobically degraded has led to the suggestion that some Geobacter species might be capable of anaerobic benzene degradation, but this has never been documented. A strain of Geobacter, designated strain Ben, was isolated from sediments from the Fe(III)-reducing zone of a petroleum-contaminated aquifer in which there was significant capacity for anaerobic benzene oxidation. Strain Ben grew in a medium with benzene as the sole electron donor and Fe(III) oxide as the sole electron acceptor. Furthermore, additional evaluation of Geobacter metallireducens demonstrated that it could also grow in benzene-Fe(III) medium. In both strain Ben and G. metallireducens the stoichiometry of benzene metabolism and Fe(III) reduction was consistent with the oxidation of benzene to carbon dioxide with Fe(III) serving as the sole electron acceptor. With benzene as the electron donor, and Fe(III) oxide (strain Ben) or Fe(III) citrate (G. metallireducens) as the electron acceptor, the cell yields of strain Ben and G. metallireducens were 3.2 {\texttimes} 10(9) and 8.4 {\texttimes} 10(9) cells/mmol of Fe(III) reduced, respectively. Strain Ben also oxidized benzene with anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) as the sole electron acceptor with cell yields of 5.9 {\texttimes} 10(9) cells/mmol of AQDS reduced. Strain Ben serves as model organism for the study of anaerobic benzene metabolism in petroleum-contaminated aquifers, and G. metallireducens is the first anaerobic benzene-degrading organism that can be genetically manipulated.},

abstract = {Phosphinothricin is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS). The resolution of the native structure of GS from Salmonella typhimurium has been extended to 2.5 A resolution, and the improved model is used to determine the structure of phosphinothricin complexed to GS by difference Fourier methods. The structure suggests a noncovalent, dead-end mechanism of inhibition. Phosphinothricin occupies the glutamate substrate pocket and stabilizes the Glu327 flap in a position which blocks the glutamate entrance to the active site, trapping the inhibitor on the enzyme. One oxygen of the phosphinyl group of phosphinothricin appears to be protonated, because of its proximity to the carboxylate group of Glu327. The other phosphinyl oxygen protrudes into the negatively charged binding pocket for the substrate ammonium, disrupting that pocket. The distribution of charges in the glutamate binding pocket is complementary to those of phosphinothricin. The presence of a second ammonium binding site within the active site is confirmed by its analogue thallous ion, marking the ammonium site and its protein ligands. The inhibition of GS by methionine sulfoximine can be explained by the same mechanism. These models of inhibited GS further illuminate its catalytic mechanism.},

They catalyze the ATP-dependent reduction of benzoyl-CoA (BCoA) to cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carboxyl-CoA (dienoyl-CoA). A Birch reduction mechanism involving alternate electron transfer and protonation steps has been proposed for BCR. In this work we reacted BCoA in H2O and D2O, and d5-BCoA in H2O with BCR and the second enzyme of the pathway, dienoyl-CoA hydratase (DCH). The 1,4 hydration product formed from the dienoyl-CoA, 6-hydroxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA, was analyzed by several NMR techniques. The results obtained indicate that BCR stereoselectively forms the trans-dienoyl-CoA product, and DCH stereoselectively catalyzes a trans-1,4 water addition. Moreover, unexpected proton exchanges at C-2 and C-6 were observed. They indicate that a free radical intermediate with an unusual low pKa is formed during BCR catalysis. This finding provides evidence for the proposed Birch reduction mechanism of BCR and is in agreement with the established radical mechanism of homologous alpha-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratases.},

abstract = {Empirical networks of weighted dyadic relations often contain "noisy" edges that alter the global characteristics of the network and obfuscate the most important structures therein. Graph pruning is the process of identifying the most significant edges according to a generative null model and extracting the subgraph consisting of those edges. Here, we focus on integer-weighted graphs commonly arising when weights count the occurrences of an "event" relating the nodes. We introduce a simple and intuitive null model related to the configuration model of network generation and derive two significance filters from it: the marginal likelihood filter (MLF) and the global likelihood filter (GLF). The former is a fast algorithm assigning a significance score to each edge based on the marginal distribution of edge weights, whereas the latter is an ensemble approach which takes into account the correlations among edges. We apply these filters to the network of air traffic volume between US airports and recover a geographically faithful representation of the graph. Furthermore, compared with thresholding based on edge weight, we show that our filters extract a larger and significantly sparser giant component. },

One explanation is that an entropy crisis, due to the rarefaction of available states, makes it increasingly arduous to reach equilibrium in that regime. Validating this scenario is challenging, because experiments offer limited resolution, while numerical studies lag more than eight orders of magnitude behind experimentally-relevant timescales. In this work we not only close the colossal gap between experiments and simulations but manage to create in-silico configurations that have no experimental analog yet. Deploying a range of computational tools, we obtain four estimates of their configurational entropy. These measurements consistently confirm that the steep entropy decrease observed in experiments is found also in simulations even beyond the experimental glass transition. Our numerical results thus open a new observational window into the physics of glasses and reinforce the relevance of an entropy crisis for understanding their formation.},

abstract = {The X-ray structure of Escherichia coli TEM1 beta-lactamase has been refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 16.4% for 22,510 reflections between 5.0 and 1.8 A resolution; 199 water molecules and 1 sulphate ion were included in refinement. Except for the tips of a few solvent-exposed side chains, all protein atoms have clear electron density and refined to an average atomic temperature factor of 11 A2. The estimated coordinates error is 0.17 A. The substrate binding site is located at the interface of the two domains of the protein and contains 4 water molecules and the sulphate anion. One of these solvent molecules is found at hydrogen bond distance from S70 and E166. S70 and S130 are hydrogen bonded to K73 and K234, respectively. It was found that the E. coli TEM1 and Staphylococcus aureus PC1 beta-lactamases crystal structures differ in the relative orientations of the two domains composing the enzymes, which result in a narrowed substrate binding cavity in the TEM1 enzyme. Local but significant differences in the vicinity of this site may explain the occurrence of TEM1 natural mutants with extended substrate specificities.},

abstract = {Rhodopsin is a G protein-coupled receptor found in the rod outer segments in the retina, which triggers a visual response under dim light conditions. Recently, a study of the late, microsecond-to-millisecond kinetics of photointermediates of the human and bovine rhodopsins in their native membranes revealed a complex, double-square mechanism of rhodopsin activation. In this kinetic scheme, the human rhodopsin exhibited more Schiff base deprotonation than bovine rhodopsin, which could arise from the ∼7% sequence difference between the two proteins, or from the difference between their membrane lipid environments. To differentiate between the effects of membrane and protein structure on the kinetics, the human and bovine rhodopsins were inserted into 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine lipid nanodiscs and the kinetics of activation at 15{\textdegree}C and pH 8.7 was investigated by time-resolved absorption spectroscopy and global kinetic analysis. For both proteins, the kinetics in nanodiscs shows the characteristics observed in the native membranes, and is described by a multisquare model with Schiff base deprotonation at the lumirhodopsin I intermediate stage. The results indicate that the protein sequence controls the extent of Schiff base deprotonation and accumulation of intermediates, and thus plays the main role in the different activation kinetics observed between human and bovine rhodopsins. The membrane lipid does have a minor role by modulating the timing of the kinetics, with the nanodisc environment leading to an earlier Schiff base deprotonation.},

abstract = {Myristic acid (C14:0) is added to the N-terminal glycine residue of the alpha subunits of certain receptor-coupled guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins). The G alpha subunit (GPA1 gene product) coupled to yeast pheromone receptors exists as a pool of both myristoylated and unmyristolyated species. After treatment of MATa cells with alpha factor, the myristoylated form of Gpa1p increases dramatically, and the unmyristoylated form decreases concomitantly. This pheromone-stimulated shift depends on the function of STE2 (alpha-factor receptor), STE11 (a protein kinase in the response pathway), and NMT1 (myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase) genes and uses the existing pool of fatty acids (is not blocked by cerulenin). Myristoylated Gpa1p persists long after pheromone is removed. Because myristoylation is essential for proper G alpha-G beta gamma association and receptor coupling, pheromone-dependent stimulation of Gpa1p myristoylation may be an important contributing factor in adaptation after signal transmission.},

abstract = {Thermophilic proteins denature at much higher temperature compared to their mesophilic homologues, in spite of high structural and sequential similarity. Computational approaches to understand this puzzle face three major challenges: (i) unfolded ensembles are usually neglected, (ii) simulation studies of the folded states are often too short, and (iii) the majority of investigations focus on a few protein pairs, obscuring the prevalence of different strategies across multiple protein systems. We address these concerns by carrying out all-atom simulations to characterize physicochemical properties of both the folded and the disordered ensemble in multiple (12) thermophilic-mesophilic homologous protein pairs. We notice two clear trends in most pairs (10 out of 12). First, specific distribution of charges in the native basin-sampled from multimicrosecond long Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories-leads to more favorable electrostatic interaction energy in thermophiles compared to mesophiles. Next, thermophilic proteins have lowered electrostatic interaction in their unfolded state-generated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation-compared to their mesophilic counterparts. The net contribution of interaction energy to folding stability, however, remains more favorable in thermophiles compared to mesophiles. The overall contribution of electrostatics quantified by combining the net interaction energy and the solvation penalty of folding-due to differential charge burial in the folded and the unfolded ensemble-is also mostly favorable in thermophilic proteins compared to mesophiles. The systems that deviate from this trend provide interesting test cases to learn more about alternate design strategies when modification of charges is not viable due to functional reasons. The unequal contribution of the unfolded state to the stability in thermophiles and mesophiles highlights the importance of modeling the disordered ensemble to understand thermophilic adaptation as well as protein stability, in general. Our integrated approach-combining finite element analysis with MC and MD-can be useful in designing charge mutations to alter protein stability.},

abstract = {Protein tyrosine kinases are attractive drug targets because many human diseases are associated with the deregulation of kinase activity. However, how the catalytic kinase domain integrates different signals and switches from an active to an inactive conformation remains incompletely understood. Here we identify an allosteric network of dynamically coupled amino acids in Src kinase that connects regulatory sites to the ATP- and substrate-binding sites. Surprisingly, reactants (ATP and peptide substrates) bind with negative cooperativity to Src kinase while products (ADP and phosphopeptide) bind with positive cooperativity. We confirm the molecular details of the signal relay through the allosteric network by biochemical studies. Experiments on two additional protein tyrosine kinases indicate that the allosteric network may be largely conserved among these enzymes. Our work provides new insights into the regulation of protein tyrosine kinases and establishes a potential conduit by which resistance mutations to ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors can affect their activity. },

The receptor activity-modifying protein transmembrane domain sits at the interface between transmembrane domains 3, 4 and 5 of CLR, and stabilizes CLR extracellular loop 2. RAMP1 makes only limited direct contact with CGRP, consistent with its function in allosteric modulation of CLR. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that RAMP1 provides stability to the receptor complex, particularly in the positioning of the extracellular domain of CLR. This work provides insights into the control of G-protein-coupled receptor function.},

abstract = {Mutagenesis of various amino acids in Escherichia coli cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) has been shown to modulate protein compressibility and dynamics [Gekko et al. (2004) Biochemistry 43, 3844-3852]. Cooperativity of cAMP binding to CRP and the apparent DNA binding affinity are perturbed [Lin and Lee (2002) Biochemistry 41, 11857-11867]. The aim of this study is to explore the effects of mutation on the surface chemistry of CRP and to define the consequences of these changes in affecting specific DNA sequence recognition by CRP. Furthermore, the role of the interplay between mutation and specific identity of the bound cyclic nucleotide in this DNA recognition was explored. In the current study, effects of eight site-specific mutations (K52N, D53H, S62F, T127L, G141Q, L148R, H159L, and K52N/H159L) on DNA recognition of four sequences (Class I (site PI of lac), Class II (site PI of gal), and synthetic sequences that are hybrids of Classes I and II sites) modulated by three different cyclic nucleotides (cAMP, cCMP, and cGMP) were investigated. All mutations altered the surface chemistry of CRP as evidenced by the change in elution properties of these proteins from different matrixes. While T127L, S62F, K52N, and H159L exhibited unexpected behavior under combinations of specific experimental conditions, such as the identity of bound cyclic nucleotide and DNA sequence, in general, results showed that the affinities of CRP for DNA were sequence-dependent, increasing in the order of lacgal26 < gal26 < lac26 < gallac26 for all the mutants in the presence of 200 microM cAMP. The apparent association constants significantly increased in the order of no cyclic nucleotide approximately cGMP < cCMP < cAMP for all the examined DNA sequences. Linear correlation between the DeltaG for CRP-DNA complex formation and the cooperativity energy for cAMP binding was observed with gallac26, gal26, and lacgal26; however, the slope of this linear correlation is DNA sequence dependent. Structural information was presented to rationalize the interplay between CRP sequence and cyclic nucleotides in defining the recognition of DNA sequences.},

We determined the crystal structure of the Galphaq-p63RhoGEF-RhoA complex, detailing the interactions of Galphaq with the Dbl and pleckstrin homology (DH and PH) domains of p63RhoGEF. These interactions involve the effector-binding site and the C-terminal region of Galphaq and appear to relieve autoinhibition of the catalytic DH domain by the PH domain. Trio, Duet, and p63RhoGEF are shown to constitute a family of Galphaq effectors that appear to activate RhoA both in vitro and in intact cells.

However, it can also cause premature assembly of protein complexes, if two interacting nascent chains are in close proximity. By analyzing known protein structures, we show that homomeric protein contacts are enriched toward the C termini of polypeptide chains across diverse proteomes. We hypothesize that this is the result of evolutionary constraints for folding to occur before assembly. Using high-throughput imaging of protein homomers in Escherichia coli and engineered protein constructs with N- and C-terminal oligomerization domains, we show that, indeed, proteins with C-terminal homomeric interface residues consistently assemble more efficiently than those with N-terminal interface residues. Using in vivo, in vitro and in silico experiments, we identify features that govern successful assembly of homomers, which have implications for protein design and expression optimization.},

abstract = {It has recently been proposed by Gunasakaran et al. that allostery may be an intrinsic property of all proteins. Here, we develop a computational method that can determine and quantify allosteric activity in any given protein. Based on Schreiber's transfer entropy formulation, our approach leads to an information transfer landscape for the protein that shows the presence of entropy sinks and sources and explains how pairs of residues communicate with each other using entropy transfer. The model can identify the residues that drive the fluctuations of others. We apply the model to Ubiquitin, whose allosteric activity has not been emphasized until recently, and show that there are indeed systematic pathways of entropy and information transfer between residues that correlate well with the activities of the protein. We use 600 nanosecond molecular dynamics trajectories for Ubiquitin and its complex with human polymerase iota and evaluate entropy transfer between all pairs of residues of Ubiquitin and quantify the binding susceptibility changes upon complex formation. We explain the complex formation propensities of Ubiquitin in terms of entropy transfer. Important residues taking part in allosteric communication in Ubiquitin predicted by our approach are in agreement with results of NMR relaxation dispersion experiments. Finally, we show that time delayed correlation of fluctuations of two interacting residues possesses an intrinsic causality that tells which residue controls the interaction and which one is controlled. Our work shows that time delayed correlations, entropy transfer and causality are the required new concepts for explaining allosteric communication in proteins.},

abstract = {Activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) initiates conformational shifts that trigger interaction with a specific G-protein subtype from a structurally homologous set. A major unsolved problem is the mechanism by which this selectivity is achieved. Structures of GPCR{\textendash}G protein complexes so far fail to reveal the origin of selectivity because they all involve one G-protein subtype (Gs). In this work, we report a structural model of the activated GPCR rhodopsin in complex with another G-protein subtype (Gi) derived from intermolecular distance mapping with DEER-EPR and refinement with modeling. Comparison of the model with structures of complexes involving Gs reveals distinct GPCR{\textendash}G protein-binding modes, the differences of which suggest key features of the structural selectivity filter. More than two decades ago, the activation mechanism for the membrane-bound photoreceptor and prototypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) rhodopsin was uncovered. Upon light-induced changes in ligand{\textendash}receptor interaction, movement of specific transmembrane helices within the receptor opens a crevice at the cytoplasmic surface, allowing for coupling of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins). The general features of this activation mechanism are conserved across the GPCR superfamily. Nevertheless, GPCRs have selectivity for distinct G-protein family members, but the mechanism of selectivity remains elusive. Structures of GPCRs in complex with the stimulatory G protein, Gs, and an accessory nanobody to stabilize the complex have been reported, providing information on the intermolecular interactions. However, to reveal the structural selectivity filters, it will be necessary to determine GPCR{\textendash}G protein structures involving other G-protein subtypes. In addition, it is important to obtain structures in the absence of a nanobody that may influence the structure. Here, we present a model for a rhodopsin{\textendash}G protein complex derived from intermolecular distance constraints between the activated receptor and the inhibitory G protein, Gi, using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and spin-labeling methodologies. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated the overall stability of the modeled complex. In the rhodopsin{\textendash}Gi complex, Gi engages rhodopsin in a manner distinct from previous GPCR{\textendash}Gs structures, providing insight into specificity determinants.},

abstract = {The mechanism by which receptors activate G proteins is unclear because a connection between the receptor and the nucleotide binding site has not been established. To investigate this mechanism, we evaluated the roles in receptor interaction of three potential receptor contact sites in alpha(s): the alpha2/beta4, alpha3/beta5, and alpha4/beta6 loops. Substitutions of alpha(i2) homologs for alpha(s) residues in the alpha2/beta4 loop and alanine substitutions of residues in the alpha4/beta6 loop do not affect activation by the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor. However, replacement of five alpha(s) residues in the alpha3/beta5 loop region with the homologous alpha(i2) residues decreases receptor-mediated activation of alpha(s) and increases the affinity of G(s) for this receptor. The substitutions do not alter guanine nucleotide binding or hydrolysis, or activation by aluminum fluoride, indicating that the effects on receptor interaction are not due to a destabilization of the guanine-nucleotide bound state. In a model of the receptor-G protein complex, the alpha3/beta5 loop maps near the second and third intracellular loops of the receptor. The effects of the alpha3/beta5 substitutions suggest that the wild-type residues may be receptor contact sites that are optimized to ensure the reversibility of receptor-G protein interactions. Furthermore, the alpha3/beta5 region corresponds to an exchange factor contact site in both EF-Tu and Ras, suggesting that the mechanisms by which seven-transmembrane receptors and exchange factors catalyze nucleotide exchange may share common elements.},

abstract = {The glucagon receptor (GCGR) belongs to the secretin-like (class B) family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and is activated by the peptide hormone glucagon. The structures of an activated class B GPCR have remained unsolved, preventing a mechanistic understanding of how these receptors are activated. Using a combination of structural modeling and mutagenesis studies, we present here two modes of ligand-independent activation of GCGR. First, we identified a GCGR-specific hydrophobic lock comprising Met-338 and Phe-345 within the IC3 loop and transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) and found that this lock stabilizes the TM6 helix in the inactive conformation. Disruption of this hydrophobic lock led to constitutive G protein and arrestin signaling. Second, we discovered a polar core comprising conserved residues in TM2, TM3, TM6, and TM7, and mutations that disrupt this polar core led to constitutive GCGR activity. On the basis of these results, we propose a mechanistic model of GCGR activation in which TM6 is held in an inactive conformation by the conserved polar core and the hydrophobic lock. Mutations that disrupt these inhibitory elements allow TM6 to swing outward to adopt an active TM6 conformation similar to that of the canonical $\beta$2-adrenergic receptor complexed with G protein and to that of rhodopsin complexed with arrestin. Importantly, mutations in the corresponding polar core of several other members of class B GPCRs, including PTH1R, PAC1R, VIP1R, and CRFR1, also induce constitutive G protein signaling, suggesting that the rearrangement of the polar core is a conserved mechanism for class B GPCR activation.},

The software, written in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well suited for parallelization on processor clusters. By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License. It is maintained by a group of developers from the Universities of Groningen, Uppsala, and Stockholm, and the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz.

abstract = {The success of targeted covalent inhibitors in the global pharmaceutical industry has led to a resurgence of covalent drug discovery. However, covalent inhibitor design for flexible binding sites remains a difficult task due to a lack of methodological development. Here, we compared covalent docking to empirical electrophile screening against the highly dynamic target K-RasG12C. While the overall hit rate of both methods was comparable, we were able to rapidly progress a docking hit to a potent irreversible covalent binder that modifies the inactive, GDP-bound state of K-RasG12C. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry was used to probe the protein dynamics of compound binding to the switch-II pocket and subsequent destabilization of the nucleotide-binding region. SOS-mediated nucleotide exchange assays showed that, contrary to prior switch-II pocket inhibitors, these new compounds appear to accelerate nucleotide exchange. This study highlights the efficiency of covalent docking as a tool for the discovery of chemically novel hits against challenging targets.},

Aliphatic protein side chains and their motions play critical roles in protein interactions: for recognition and binding of partner molecules at the surface or serving as an entropy reservoir within the hydrophobic core. Here, we present a new NMR method based on high-resolution relaxometry and high-field relaxation to determine quantitatively both motional amplitudes and time scales of methyl-bearing side chains in the picosecond-to-nanosecond range. We detect a wide variety of motions in isoleucine side chains in the protein ubiquitin. We unambiguously identify slow motions in the low nanosecond range, which, in conjunction with molecular dynamics computer simulations, could be assigned to transitions between rotamers. Our approach provides unmatched detailed insight into the motions of aliphatic side chains in proteins and provides a better understanding of the nature and functional role of protein side-chain motions.},

In this Letter we show that this phenomenon not only emerges in the search for new Planck-scale laws but also in lattice models of classical and quantum physics: the information contained in part of a system in thermal equilibrium obeys an area law. While the maximal information per unit area depends classically only on the number of degrees of freedom, it may diverge as the inverse temperature in quantum systems. It is shown that an area law is generally implied by a finite correlation length when measured in terms of the mutual information.},

abstract = {Conformational selection and induced fit are well-known contributors to ligand binding and allosteric effects in proteins. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations now enable the theoretical study of protein-ligand binding in terms of ensembles of interconverting microstates and the population shifts characteristic of "dynamical allostery." Here we investigate protein-ligand binding and allostery based on a Markov state model (MSM) with states and rates obtained from all-atom MD simulations. As an exemplary case, we consider the single domain protein par-6 PDZ with and without ligand and allosteric effector. This is one of the smallest proteins in which allostery has been experimentally observed. In spite of the increased complexity intrinsic to a statistical ensemble perspective, we find that conformational selection and induced fit mechanisms can be readily identified in the analysis. In the nonallosteric pathway, MD-MSM shows that PDZ binds ligand via conformational selection. However, the allosteric pathway requires an activation step that involves a conformational change induced by the allosteric effector Cdc42. Once in the allosterically activated state, we find that ligand binding can proceed by conformational selection. Our MD-MSM model predicts that allostery in this and possibly other systems involves both induced fit and conformational selection, not just one or the other.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:G proteins are intracellular switches that transduce and amplify extracellular signals from G protein-coupled receptors. The Gq protein subtypes, which are coupled to phospholipase C activation, can act as oncogenes, and their expression was reported to be upregulated in cancer and inflammatory diseases. Gq inhibition may be an efficient therapeutic strategy constituting a new level of intervention. However, diagnostic tools and therapeutic drugs for Gq proteins are lacking.

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH:We have now developed Gq -specific, cell-permeable 3 H-labeled high-affinity probes based on the macrocyclic depsipeptides FR900359 (FR) and YM-254890 (YM). The tracers served to specifically label and quantify Gq proteins in their native conformation in cells and tissues with high accuracy.

KEY RESULTS:FR and YM displayed low nanomolar affinity for G$\alpha$q , G$\alpha$11 , and G$\alpha$14 expressed in CRISPR/Cas9 G$\alpha$q -knock-out cells, but not for G$\alpha$15 . The two structurally very similar tracers showed strikingly different dissociation kinetics, which is predicted to result in divergent biological effects. Computational studies suggested a "dowel" effect of the pseudoirreversibly binding FR. A high-throughput binding assay led to the discovery of novel Gq inhibitors, which inhibited Gq signaling in recombinant cells and primary murine brown adipocytes, resulting in enhanced differentiation.

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS:The Gq protein inhibitors YM and FR are pharmacologically different despite similar structures. The new versatile tools and powerful assays will contribute to the advancement of the rising field of G protein research.},

abstract = {Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. The catalytic rate in this system has been found to be significantly affected by mutations far from the site of chemical activity in the enzyme [Rajagopalan, P. T. R, Lutz, S., and Benkovic, S. J. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 12618-12628]. On the basis of extensive computer simulations for wild-type DHFR from Escherichia coli and four mutants (G121S, G121V, M42F, and M42F/G121S), we show that key parameters for catalysis are changed. The parameters we study are relative populations of different conformations sampled and hydrogen bonds. We find that the mutations result in long-range structural perturbations, rationalizing the effects that the mutations have on the kinetics of the enzyme. Such perturbations also provide a rationalization for the reported nonadditivity effect for double mutations. We finally examine the role a structural perturbation will have on the hydride transfer step. On the basis of our new findings, we discuss the role of coupled motions between distant regions in the enzyme, which previously was reported by Radkiewicz and Brooks.},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors transduce diverse extracellular signals, such as neurotransmitters, hormones, chemokines, and sensory stimuli, into intracellular responses through activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. G proteins play critical roles in determining specificity and kinetics of subsequent biological responses by modulation of effector proteins. We have developed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay to directly measure mammalian G protein activation in intact cells and found that Gi proteins activate within 1-2 s, which is considerably slower than activation kinetics of the receptors themselves. More importantly, FRET measurements demonstrated that Galphai- and Gbetagamma-subunits do not dissociate during activation, as has been previously postulated. Based on FRET measurements between Galphai-yellow fluorescent protein and Gbetagamma-subunits that were fused to cyan fluorescent protein at various positions, we conclude that, instead, G protein subunits undergo a molecular rearrangement during activation. The detection of a persistent heterotrimeric composition during G protein activation will impact the understanding of how G proteins achieve subtype-selective coupling to effectors. This finding will be of particular interest for unraveling Gbetagamma-induced signaling pathways.},

abstract = {Several studies in recent years have drawn attention to the ability of proteins to adapt to intermolecular interactions by conformational changes along structure-encoded collective modes of motions. These so-called soft modes, primarily driven by entropic effects, facilitate, if not enable, functional interactions. They represent excursions on the conformational space along principal low-ascent directions/paths away from the original free energy minimum, and they are accessible to the protein even before protein-protein/ligand interactions. An emerging concept from these studies is the evolution of structures or modular domains to favor such modes of motion that will be recruited or integrated for enabling functional interactions. Structural dynamics, including the allosteric switches in conformation that are often stabilized upon formation of complexes and multimeric assemblies, emerge as key properties that are evolutionarily maintained to accomplish biological activities, consistent with the paradigm sequence{\textrightarrow}structure{\textrightarrow}dynamics{\textrightarrow}function where 'dynamics' bridges structure and function.},

TRAM estimates a multiensemble Markov model (MEMM) with full thermodynamic and kinetic information at all ensembles. The approach combines the benefits of Markov state models-clustering of high-dimensional spaces and modeling of complex many-state systems-with those of the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio of exploiting biased or high-temperature ensembles to accelerate rare-event sampling. TRAM does not depend on any rate model in addition to the widely used Markov state model approximation, but uses only fundamental relations such as detailed balance and binless reweighting of configurations between ensembles. Previous methods, including the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio, discrete TRAM, and Markov state models are special cases and can be derived from the TRAM equations. TRAM is demonstrated by efficiently computing MEMMs in cases where other estimators break down, including the full thermodynamics and rare-event kinetics from high-dimensional simulation data of an all-atom protein-ligand binding model.},

Though effective, these drugs are often promiscuous. With the realization that GPCRs signal via multiple pathways, and with the emergence of crystal structures for this family of proteins, there is an opportunity to target GPCRs with new chemotypes and confer new signaling modalities. We consider structure-based and physical screening methods that have led to the discovery of new reagents, focusing particularly on the former. We illustrate their use against previously untargeted or orphan GPCRs, against allosteric sites, and against classical orthosteric sites that selectively activate one downstream pathway over others. The ligands that emerge are often chemically novel, which can lead to new biological effects.},

In this study, CTX-M-14 was used as a model to study the structural changes caused by the P167S mutation that accelerate ceftazidime turnover. X-ray crystallography was used to determine the structures of the P167S apoenzyme along with the structures of the S70G/P167S, E166A/P167S, and E166A mutant enzymes complexed with ceftazidime as well as the E166A/P167S apoenzyme. The S70G and E166A mutations allow capture of the enzyme-substrate complex and the acylated form of ceftazidime, respectively. The results showed a large conformational change in the $\Omega$-loop of the ceftazidime acyl-enzyme complex of the P167S mutant but not in the enzyme-substrate complex, suggesting the change occurs upon acylation. The change results in a larger active site that prevents steric clash between the aminothiazole ring of ceftazidime and the Asn170 residue in the $\Omega$-loop, allowing accommodation of ceftazidime for hydrolysis. In addition, the conformational change was not observed in the E166A/P167S apoenzyme, suggesting the presence of acylated ceftazidime influences the conformational change. Finally, the E166A acyl-enzyme structure with ceftazidime did not exhibit the altered conformation, indicating the P167S substitution is required for the change. Taken together, the results reveal that the P167S substitution and the presence of acylated ceftazidime both drive the structure toward a conformational change in the $\Omega$-loop and that in CTX-M P167S enzymes found in drug-resistant bacteria this will lead to an increased level of ceftazidime hydrolysis.},

Binding to G(alphao) increases baseline analog fluorescence by 6-, 8.5-, 2.8-, 3.5-, and 3.0-fold, respectively. Binding of GTPgammaS and GppNHp analogs to G(alphao) is of high affinity (K(D) 11, 17, 55, and 110 nM, respectively) and reaches a stable plateau while fluorescence of BODIPY FL GTP shows a transient increase which returns to baseline. Furthermore, BODIPY FL GTPgammaS shows varying affinities for alpha(o), alpha(s), alpha(i1), and alpha(i2) (6, 58, 150, and 300 nM). The affinities of BODIPY FL GppNHp for all four G(alpha) subunits are 10-fold lower than for BODIPY FL GTPgammaS. Half-times for the fluorescence increase are consistent with known GDP release rates for those proteins. Enhancement of fluorescence upon binding the G(alpha) subunit is most likely due to a rotation around the gamma-thiol (GTPgammaS) or the 3' ribose-hydroxyl (GppNHp) bond to relieve the quenching of BODIPY fluorescence by the guanine base. Binding to G(alpha) exposes the BODIPY moiety to the external environment, as seen by an increase in sodium iodide quenching. The visible excitation and emission spectra and high fluorescence levels of these probes permit robust real-time detection of nucleotide binding.},

abstract = {Binding of guanine nucleotides to heterotrimeric G proteins is controlled primarily by kinetic factors, such as the release of bound GDP, rather than by affinity alone. Detergent-solubilized Galpha(q) displays unusual guanine nucleotide binding properties in comparison with other G protein alpha subunits. Under conditions where most G proteins bind nearly stoichiometric GTPgammaS in 5-30 min at micromolar nucleotide concentrations, GTPgammaS binding to Galpha(q) is slow (>1 hr to completion), markedly substoichiometric, and dependent upon high concentrations of nucleotide (0.1 to 0.2 mM). Although the latter two properties suggest low affinity, GTPgammaS dissociation is immeasurably slow under commonly used conditions. We found that purified Galpha(q) can bind stoichiometric GTPgammaS, but that binding is controlled kinetically by a combination of factors. GDP (or IDP) dissociated slowly from Galpha(q), but the dissociation rate increased linearly with the concentration of (NH4)2SO4 up to 0.75 M (approximately 20-fold acceleration). The resulting GDP-free Galpha(q) was labile to rapid and irreversible denaturation, however (rate constant > or = 1 min(-1) at 20 degrees). Denaturation competed kinetically with relatively slow GTPgammaS association, such that stoichiometric binding was only attained at 100 microM GTPgammaS. These findings reconcile the slowly reversible binding of GTPgammaS to Galpha(q) with the other behaviors that suggested lower affinity, and point out that events subsequent to GDP dissociation can markedly influence the rates and extents of guanine nucleotide binding to G protein alpha subunits. Understanding these interactions allowed the direct, accurate quantitation of active Galpha(q) by a simple GTPgammaS binding assay in the presence of (NH4)2SO4, and similarly can prevent underestimation of the concentrations of other G proteins.},

abstract = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are essential for the detection of extracellular stimuli by cells and transfer the encoded information via the activation of functionally distinct subsets of heterotrimeric G proteins into intracellular signals. Despite enormous achievements toward understanding GPCR structures, major aspects of the GPCR-G-protein selectivity mechanism remain unresolved. As this can be attributed to the lack of suitable and broadly applicable assays, we set out to develop a quantitative FRET-based assay to study kinetics and affinities of G protein binding to activated GPCRs in membranes of permeabilized cells in the absence of nucleotides. We measured the association and dissociation kinetics of agonist-induced binding of Gi/o, Gq/11, Gs, and G12/13 proteins to muscarinic M1, M2, and M3 receptors in the absence of nucleotides between fluorescently labeled G proteins and receptors expressed in mammalian cells. Our results show a strong quantitative correlation between not the on-rates of G-protein-M3-R interactions but rather the affinities of Gq and Go proteins to M3-Rs, their GPCR-G-protein lifetime and their coupling efficiencies determined in intact cells, suggesting that the G-protein subtype-specific affinity to the activated receptor in the absence of nucleotides is, in fact, a major determinant of the coupling efficiency. Our broadly applicable FRET-based assay represents a fast and reliable method to quantify the intrinsic affinity and relative coupling selectivity of GPCRs toward all G-protein subtypes.},

abstract = {Allosteric regulation is used as a very efficient mechanism to control protein activity in most biological processes, including signal transduction, metabolism, catalysis and gene regulation. Allosteric proteins can exist in several conformational states with distinct binding or enzymatic activity. Effectors are considered to function in a purely structural manner by selectively stabilizing a specific conformational state, thereby regulating protein activity. Here we show that allosteric proteins can be regulated predominantly by changes in their structural dynamics. We have used NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry to characterize cyclic AMP (cAMP) binding to the catabolite activator protein (CAP), a transcriptional activator that has been a prototype for understanding effector-mediated allosteric control of protein activity. cAMP switches CAP from the 'off' state (inactive), which binds DNA weakly and non-specifically, to the 'on' state (active), which binds DNA strongly and specifically. In contrast, cAMP binding to a single CAP mutant, CAP-S62F, fails to elicit the active conformation; yet, cAMP binding to CAP-S62F strongly activates the protein for DNA binding. NMR and thermodynamic analyses show that despite the fact that CAP-S62F-cAMP(2) adopts the inactive conformation, its strong binding to DNA is driven by a large conformational entropy originating in enhanced protein motions induced by DNA binding. The results provide strong evidence that changes in protein motions may activate allosteric proteins that are otherwise structurally inactive.},

abstract = {Author Summary Proteins in their native state can adopt a plethora of shapes, or conformations; this conformational plasticity is critical for regulation and function in many systems. However, it has remained difficult to determine what these different conformations look like at the atomic level. We present a novel way to use Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Molecular Dynamics Simulations, and Markov State Models to uncover a map of this plethora of conformations that is consistent with the available data. We applied this method to study the intrinsic dynamics used in substrate binding by the WW domain of the Pin1 proline cis-trans isomerase and found that the NMR data were best explained by two slowly-interconverting sets of many metastable conformations rather than two distinct macrostates. Substantial value is added to the NMR data by our method since it provides a kinetic {\textquotedblleft}map{\textquotedblright} of conformational changes consistent with the observed relaxation data. Such an approach, in combination with information theory, helped us to identify specific conformational changes that might couple substrate binding at the Pin1 WW domain to the catalytic subunit.},

We have developed an approach combining isothermal titration calorimetry, circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify allostery in terms of protein thermodynamics, structure and dynamics. This strategy was applied to study the interaction between aminoglycoside N-(6')-acetyltransferase-Ii and one of its substrates, acetyl coenzyme A. It was found that homotropic allostery between the two active sites of the homodimeric enzyme is modulated by opposing mechanisms. One follows a classical Koshland-N{\'e}methy-Filmer (KNF) paradigm, whereas the other follows a recently proposed mechanism in which partial unfolding of the subunits is coupled to ligand binding.

abstract = {Patterns of interacting amino acids are so preserved within protein families that the sole analysis of evolutionary comutations can identify pairs of contacting residues. It is also known that evolution conserves functional dynamics, i.e., the concerted motion or displacement of large protein regions or domains. Is it, therefore, possible to use a pure sequence-based analysis to identify these dynamical domains? To address this question, we introduce here a general coevolutionary coupling analysis strategy and apply it to a curated sequence database of hundreds of protein families. For most families, the sequence-based method partitions amino acids into a few clusters. When viewed in the context of the native structure, these clusters have the signature characteristics of viable protein domains: They are spatially separated but individually compact. They have a direct functional bearing too, as shown for various reference cases. We conclude that even large-scale structural and functionally related properties can be recovered from inference methods applied to evolutionary-related sequences. The method introduced here is available as a software package and web server (spectrus.sissa.it/spectrus-evo_webserver).},

abstract = {A general model is presented whereby ligand-induced changes in protein dynamics could produce allosteric communication between distinct binding sites, even in the absence of a macromolecular conformational change. Theoretical analysis, based on the statistical thermodynamics of ligand binding, shows that cooperative interaction free energies amounting to several kJ . mol-1 may be generated by this means. The effect arises out of the possible changes in frequencies and amplitudes of macromolecular thermal fluctuations in response to ligand attachment, and can involve all forms of dynamic behaviour, ranging from highly correlated, low-frequency normal mode vibrations to random local anharmonic motions of individual atoms or groups. Dynamic allostery of this form is primarily an entropy effect, and we derive approximate expressions which might allow the magnitude of the interaction in real systems to be calculated directly from experimental observations such as changes in normal mode frequencies and mean-square atomic displacements. Long-range influence of kinetic processes at different sites might also be mediated by a similar mechanism. We suggest that proteins and other biological macromolecules may have evolved to take functional advantage not only of mean conformational states but also of the inevitable thermal fluctuations about the mean.},

Different patterns of receptor phosphorylation (phosphorylation barcode) can modulate arrestin conformations, resulting in distinct functional outcomes (for example, desensitization, internalization, and downstream signaling). However, the mechanism of arrestin activation and how distinct receptor phosphorylation patterns could induce different conformational changes on arrestin are not fully understood. We analyzed how each arrestin amino acid contributes to its different conformational states. We identified a conserved structural motif that restricts the mobility of the arrestin finger loop in the inactive state and appears to be regulated by receptor phosphorylation. Distal and proximal receptor phosphorylation sites appear to selectively engage with distinct arrestin structural motifs (that is, micro-locks) to induce different arrestin conformations. These observations suggest a model in which different phosphorylation patterns of the GPCR C terminus can combinatorially modulate the conformation of the finger loop and other phosphorylation-sensitive structural elements to drive distinct arrestin conformation and functional outcomes.},

Accurate classical force fields could, in principle, complement these quantum-chemical tools. A relatively simple way to validate vibrational frequencies is by computing thermochemical properties. We present such a validation for over 1800 small molecules using the harmonic approximation. Two popular empirical force fields (GAFF and CGenFF) are compared to experimental data and results from Gaussian-4 quantum-chemical calculations. Frequency scaling factors of 1.035 (CGenFF) and 1.018 (GAFF) are derived from the zero-point energies. The force field calculations have larger deviation from experiment than the G4 method for standard entropy, but for heat capacity the results are comparable. For internal thermal energy and zero-point energy the deviations from G4 are relatively small. The work suggests that with some tuning force fields could indeed complement DFT in spectroscopical applications.},

abstract = {Switchable proteins that can be regulated through exogenous or endogenous inputs have a broad range of biotechnological and biomedical applications. Here we describe the design of switchable enzymes based on an ensemble allosteric model. First, we insert an enzyme domain into an effector-binding domain such that both domains remain functionally intact. Second, we induce the fusion to behave as a switch through the introduction of conditional conformational flexibility designed to increase the conformational entropy of the enzyme domain in a temperature- or pH-dependent fashion. We confirm the switching behaviour in vitro and in vivo. Structural and thermodynamic studies support the hypothesis that switching result from an increase in conformational entropy of the enzyme domain in the absence of effector. These results support the ensemble model of allostery and embody a strategy for the design of protein switches. },

abstract = {The structural and mechanical properties of monomeric actin (G-actin), the trimer nucleus, and actin filaments (F-actins) are determined as a function of the conformation of the DNase I-binding loop (DB loop) by using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and coarse-grained (CG) analysis. Recent x-ray structures of ADP-bound G-actin (G-ADP) by Otterbein et al. [Otterbein, L. R., Graceffa, P. {\&} Dominguez, R. (2001) Science 293, 708-711] and ATP-bound G-actin (G-ATP) by Graceffa and Dominguez [Graceffa, P. {\&} Dominguez, R. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 34172-34180] indicate that the DB loop of actin does not have a well defined secondary structure in the ATP state but folds into an alpha-helix in the ADP state. MD simulations and CG analysis indicate that such a helical DB loop significantly weakens the intermonomer interactions of actin assemblies and thus leads to a wider, shorter, and more disordered filament. The computed persistence lengths of F-actin composed of G-ATP (16 microm) and of G-ADP (8.5 microm) agree well with the experimental values for the two states. Therefore, the loop-to-helix transition of the DB loop may be one of the factors that lead to the changes in structural and mechanical properties of F-actin after ATP hydrolysis. This result may provide a direct connection between the conformational changes of an actin monomer and the structural and mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton. The information provided by MD simulations also helps to understand the possible origin of the special features of actin dynamics.},

It is a single-molecule property and contains all mechanistic information of folding processes of biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. However, the transition path has been difficult to probe because it is short and rarely visited when transitions actually occur. Recent technical advances in single-molecule spectroscopy have made it possible to directly probe transition paths, which has opened up new theoretical and experimental approaches to investigating folding mechanisms. This article reviews recent single-molecule fluorescence and force spectroscopic measurements of transition path times and their connection to both theory and simulations.},

abstract = {The sensitivity of molecular dynamics on changes in the potential energy function plays an important role in understanding the dynamics and function of complex molecules. We present a method to obtain path ensemble averages of a perturbed dynamics from a set of paths generated by a reference dynamics. It is based on the concept of path probability measure and the Girsanov theorem, a result from stochastic analysis to estimate a change of measure of a path ensemble. Since Markov state models (MSMs) of the molecular dynamics can be formulated as a combined phase-space and path ensemble average, the method can be extended to reweight MSMs by combining it with a reweighting of the Boltzmann distribution. We demonstrate how to efficiently implement the Girsanov reweighting in a molecular dynamics simulation program by calculating parts of the reweighting factor "on the fly" during the simulation, and we benchmark the method on test systems ranging from a two-dimensional diffusion process and an artificial many-body system to alanine dipeptide and valine dipeptide in implicit and explicit water. The method can be used to study the sensitivity of molecular dynamics on external perturbations as well as to reweight trajectories generated by enhanced sampling schemes to the original dynamics.},

abstract = {Substrate binding cooperativity in protein kinase A (PKA) seems to involve allosteric coupling between the two binding sites. It received significant attention, but its molecular basis still remains not entirely clear. Based on long molecular dynamics of PKA and its complexes, we characterized an allosteric pathway that links ATP binding to the redistribution of states adopted by a protein substrate positioning segment in favor of those that warrant correct binding. We demonstrate that the cooperativity mechanism critically depends on the presence of water in two distinct, buried hydration sites. One holds just a single water molecule, which acts as a switchable hydrogen bond bridge along the allosteric pathway. The second, filled with partially disordered solvent, is essential for providing a smooth free energy landscape underlying conformational transitions of the peptide binding region. Our findings remain in agreement with experimental data, also concerning the cooperativity abolishing effect of the Y204A mutation, and indicate a plausible molecular mechanism contributing to experimentally observed binding cooperativity of the two substrates.},

abstract = {Obtaining the correct balance of secondary structure propensities is a central priority in protein force-field development. Given that current force fields differ significantly in their alpha-helical propensities, a correction to match experimental results would be highly desirable. We have determined simple backbone energy corrections for two force fields to reproduce the fraction of helix measured in short peptides at 300 K. As validation, we show that the optimized force fields produce results in excellent agreement with nuclear magnetic resonance experiments for folded proteins and short peptides not used in the optimization. However, despite the agreement at ambient conditions, the dependence of the helix content on temperature is too weak, a problem shared with other force fields. A fit of the Lifson-Roig helix-coil theory shows that both the enthalpy and entropy of helix formation are too small: the helix extension parameter w agrees well with experiment, but its entropic and enthalpic components are both only about half the respective experimental estimates. Our structural and thermodynamic analyses point toward the physical origins of these shortcomings in current force fields, and suggest ways to address them in future force-field development.},

abstract = {We have developed a method to capture the essential conformational dynamics of folded biopolymers using statistical analysis of coarse-grained segment-segment contacts. Previously, the residue-residue contact analysis of simulation trajectories was successfully applied to the detection of conformational switching motions in biomolecular complexes. However, the application to large protein systems (larger than 1000 amino acid residues) is challenging using the description of residue contacts. Also, the residue-based method cannot be used to compare proteins with different sequences. To expand the scope of the method, we have tested several coarse-graining schemes that group a collection of consecutive residues into a segment. The definition of these segments may be derived from structural and sequence information, while the interaction strength of the coarse-grained segment-segment contacts is a function of the residue-residue contacts. We then perform covariance calculations on these coarse-grained contact matrices. We monitored how well the principal components of the contact matrices is preserved using various rendering functions. The new method was demonstrated to assist the reduction of the degrees of freedom for describing the conformation space, and it potentially allows for the analysis of a system that is approximately tenfold larger compared with the corresponding residue contact-based method. This method can also render a family of similar proteins into the same conformational space, and thus can be used to compare the structures of proteins with different sequences.},

A quantitative and predictive description of allostery is fundamental for understanding biological processes. Here, we integrate an ensemble-based perturbation approach with the analysis of biomolecular rigidity and flexibility to construct a model of dynamic allostery. Our model by definition excludes the possibility of conformational changes, evaluates static, not dynamic, properties of molecular systems, and describes allosteric effects due to ligand binding in terms of a novel free energy measure. We validated our model on three distinct biomolecular systems, eglin c, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, and the lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 domain. In all cases, it successfully identified key residues for signal transmission in very good agreement with experiment. It correctly and quantitatively discriminated between positively or negatively cooperative effects for one of the systems. Our model should be a promising tool for the rational discovery of novel allosteric drugs.},

abstract = {The reversible association of alpha and beta gamma subunits of GTP-binding proteins is important for signal transmission from a variety of cell-surface receptors to intracellular effectors. Previous work showed that 1,6-bis(maleimido)hexane, which crosslinks cysteine residues, crosslinks alpha o and alpha i-1 to beta gamma. These crosslinks are likely to form through a conserved cysteine because 1,6-bis(maleimido)hexane can also crosslink alpha i-2, alpha 1, alpha s and Drosophila alpha 1 to give products of the same apparent molecular weight as crosslinked alpha o beta gamma and alpha i-1 beta gamma. These proteins have only two cysteines in common. Therefore, we mutated each of the two conserved cysteines of alpha o to alanines. Mutation of Cys215 prevents crosslinking to beta gamma, but does not affect binding of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate or the ability of the mutated alpha subunit to bind beta gamma. In models of the alpha subunit based on the crystal structure of p21ras, Cys215 is located on the face opposite to the GTP-binding site and near an area that changes conformation depending on the nucleotide bound. This surface on the alpha subunit overlaps a putative effector binding region, raising important questions about the spatial organization of the proteins as they form ternary complexes. Mutation of Cys325 has no effect on crosslinking but, surprisingly, decreases by a factor of 10 the affinity of the mutated protein for GDP, relative to wild type, without changing the affinity for guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate. This mutation falls within a region thought to contact receptors and may represent a site through which receptors enhance the release of GDP.},

abstract = {Allosteric drug development holds promise for delivering medicines that are more selective and less toxic than those that target orthosteric sites. To date, the discovery of allosteric binding sites and lead compounds has been mostly serendipitous, achieved through high-throughput screening. Over the past decade, structural data has become more readily available for larger protein systems and more membrane protein classes (e.g., GPCRs and ion channels), which are common allosteric drug targets. In parallel, improved simulation methods now provide better atomistic understanding of the protein dynamics and cooperative motions that are critical to allosteric mechanisms. As a result of these advances, the field of predictive allosteric drug development is now on the cusp of a new era of rational structure-based computational methods. Here, we review algorithms that predict allosteric sites based on sequence data and molecular dynamics simulations, describe tools that assess the druggability of these pockets, and discuss how Markov state models and topology analyses provide insight into the relationship between protein dynamics and allosteric drug binding. In each section, we first provide an overview of the various method classes before describing relevant algorithms and software packages.},

abstract = {The extent to which current force fields faithfully reproduce conformational properties of lipids in bilayer membranes, and whether these reflect the structural principles established for phospholipids in bilayer crystals, are central to biomembrane simulations. We determine the distribution of dihedral angles in palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine from molecular dynamics simulations of hydrated fluid bilayer membranes. We compare results from the widely used lipid force field of Berger et~al. with those from the most recent C36 release of the CHARMM force field for lipids. Only the CHARMM force field produces the chain inequivalence with sn-1 as leading chain that is characteristic of glycerolipid packing in fluid bilayers. The exposure and high partial charge of the backbone carbonyls in Berger lipids leads to artifactual binding of Na+ ions reported in the literature. Both force fields predict coupled, near-symmetrical distributions of headgroup dihedral angles, which is compatible with models of interconverting mirror-image conformations used originally to interpret NMR order parameters. The Berger force field produces rotamer populations that correspond to the headgroup conformation found in a phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayer crystal, whereas CHARMM36 rotamer populations are closer to the more relaxed crystal conformations of phosphatidylethanolamine and glycerophosphocholine. CHARMM36 alone predicts the correct relative signs of the time-average headgroup order parameters, and reasonably reproduces the full range of NMR data from the phosphate diester to the choline methyls. There is strong motivation to seek further experimental criteria for verifying predicted conformational distributions in the choline headgroup, including the 31P chemical shift anisotropy and 14N and CD3 NMR quadrupole splittings.},

However, the G protein coupling profiles of melatonin receptor subtypes have not been fully characterised and alternative G protein coupling is evident. The five C-terminal residues of Galpha subunits confer coupling specificity to G protein-coupled receptors. This report outlines the use of Galphas chimaeras to alter the signal output of human melatonin receptors and investigate their interaction with the C-termini of Galpha subunits. The Galphas portion of the chimaeras confers the ability to activate adenylate cyclase leading to cyclic AMP production. Co-transfection of HEK293 cells expressing MT(1) or MT(2) melatonin receptors with Galphas chimaeras and a cyclic AMP activated luciferase construct provided a convenient and sensitive assay system for identification of receptor recognition of Galpha C-termini. Luciferase assay sensitivity was compared with measurement of cyclic AMP elevations by radioimmunoassay. Differential interactions of the melatonin receptor subtypes with Galpha chimaeras were observed. Temporal and kinetic parameters of cyclic AMP responses measured by cyclic AMP radioimmunoassay varied depending on the Galphas chimaeras coupled. Recognition of the C-terminal five amino acids of the Galpha subunit is a requisite for coupling to a receptor, but it is not the sole determinant.},

The Markov state model (MSM) approach aims to address two key challenges of molecular simulation: 1) How to reach long timescales using short simulations of detailed molecular models. 2) How to systematically gain insight from the resulting sea of data. MSMs do this by providing a compact representation of the vast conformational space available to biomolecules by decomposing it into states sets of rapidly interconverting conformations and the rates of transitioning between states. This kinetic definition allows one to easily vary the temporal and spatial resolution of an MSM from high-resolution models capable of quantitative agreement with (or prediction of) experiment to low-resolution models that facilitate understanding. Additionally, MSMs facilitate the calculation of quantities that are difficult to obtain from more direct MD analyses, such as the ensemble of transition pathways. This book introduces the mathematical foundations of Markov models, how they can be used to analyze simulations and drive efficient simulations, and some of the insights these models have yielded in a variety of applications of molecular simulation.},

abstract = {Heterotrimeric G proteins play a pivotal role in the signal-transduction pathways initiated by G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation. Agonist-receptor binding causes GDP-to-GTP exchange and dissociation of the G$\alpha$ subunit from the heterotrimeric G protein, leading to downstream signaling. Here, we studied the internal mobility of a G-protein $\alpha$ subunit in its apo and nucleotide-bound forms and characterized their dynamical features at multiple time scales using solution NMR, small-angle X-ray scattering, and molecular dynamics simulations. We find that binding of GTP analogs leads to a rigid and closed arrangement of the G$\alpha$ subdomain, whereas the apo and GDP-bound forms are considerably more open and dynamic. Furthermore, we were able to detect two conformational states of the G$\alpha$ Ras domain in slow exchange whose populations are regulated by binding to nucleotides and a GPCR. One of these conformational states, the open state, binds to the GPCR; the second conformation, the closed state, shows no interaction with the receptor. Binding to the GPCR stabilizes the open state. This study provides an in-depth analysis of the conformational landscape and the switching function of a G-protein $\alpha$ subunit and the influence of a GPCR in that landscape.},

Individual molecule is depicted as an assembly of seven hard spheres, organized to mimic the Y--shaped antibody. We consider the antibody--antibody interactions either through Fab, Fab' (two Fab fragments may be different), or Fc domain. Interaction between these three domains of the molecule (hereafter denoted as A, B, and C, respectively) is modeled by a short--range square--well attraction. To obtain numerical results for the model under study we adapt Wertheim's thermodynamic perturbation theory. We use this model to calculate the liquid--liquid phase separation curve and the second virial coefficient, B_2. Various interaction scenarios are examined to see how the strength of the site--site interactions and their range shape the coexistence curve. In the asymmetric case, where an attraction between two sites is favored and the interaction energies for the other sites kept constant, critical temperature first increases and than strongly decreases. Some more microscopic information, for example, the probability for the particular two sites to be connected, has been calculated. Analysis of the experimental liquid--liquid phase diagrams, obtained from literature, is presented. In addition, we calculate the second virial coefficient under conditions leading to the liquid--liquid phase separation and present this quantity on the graph B_2 versus protein concentration.},

abstract = {Novel guanine nucleotide analogues have been used to investigate the role of Mg(2+) in nucleotide release and binding with the small G protein rac. The fluorescent analogues have 7-(ethylamino)-8-bromocoumarin-3-carboxylic acid attached to the 3'-position of the ribose via an ethylenediamine linker. This modification has only small effects on the interaction with rac. There are large fluorescence changes on binding of the triphosphate to rac, on hydrolysis, and then on release of the diphosphate. Furthermore, the fluorescence is sensitive to the presence of Mg(2+) in the active site. Using this signal, it was shown that, for a variety of conditions, the nucleotides dissociate by a two-step mechanism. Mg(2+) is released first followed by the nucleotide. With the diphosphate, Mg(2+) is fast and nucleotide release slow. For the fluorescent GMPPNP analogue, the rate of dissociation is limited by Mg(2+) release. In the latter case, Mg(2+) binds tightly with a K(d) of 61 nM, whereas for the diphosphate the K(d) is 11 microM (30 degrees C, pH 7.6).},

abstract = {The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) accelerates heart rate, increases cardiac contractility, and constricts resistance vessels. The activity of SNS efferent nerves is generated by a complex neural network containing neurons and glia. Gq G protein-coupled receptor (Gq-GPCR) signaling in glial fibrillary acidic protein-expressing (GFAP(+)) glia in the central nervous system supports neuronal function and regulates neuronal activity. It is unclear how Gq-GPCR signaling in GFAP(+) glia affects the activity of sympathetic neurons or contributes to SNS-regulated cardiovascular functions. In this study, we investigated whether Gq-GPCR activation in GFAP(+) glia modulates the regulatory effect of the SNS on the heart; transgenic mice expressing Gq-coupled DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) (hM3Dq) selectively in GFAP(+) glia were used to address this question in vivo. We found that acute Gq-GPCR activation in peripheral GFAP(+) glia significantly accelerated heart rate and increased left ventricle contraction. Pharmacological experiments suggest that the glial-induced cardiac changes were due to Gq-GPCR activation in satellite glial cells within the sympathetic ganglion; this activation led to increased norepinephrine (NE) release and beta-1 adrenergic receptor activation within the heart. Chronic glial Gq-GPCR activation led to hypotension in female Gfap-hM3Dq mice. This study provides direct evidence that Gq-GPCR activation in peripheral GFAP(+) glia regulates cardiovascular functions in vivo.},

In this work, we illustrate how this nonlinear latent embedding can be used as a collective variable for enhanced sampling and present a simple modification that allows us to rapidly perform sampling in multiple related systems. We first demonstrate our method is able to describe the effects of force field changes in capped alanine dipeptide after learning about a model using AMBER99. We further provide a simple extension to variational dynamics encoders that allows the model to be trained in a more efficient manner on larger systems by encoding the outputs of a linear transformation using time-structure based independent component analysis (tICA). Using this technique, we show how such a model trained for one protein, the WW domain, can efficiently be transferred to perform enhanced sampling on a related mutant protein, the GTT mutation. This method shows promise for its ability to rapidly sample related systems using a single transferable collective variable, enabling us to probe the effects of variation in increasingly large systems of biophysical interest.},

Using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance and molecular dynamics simulations, we unraveled the molecular determinants underlying cargo capture and release encoded in the receptor architecture. Our findings revealed receptor dynamics over several time scales associated with binding and release of the essential cofactor Ca(2+) controlled by the coupled motions of two loops. Applying mutual information theory and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified an allosteric intradomain network that modulates the Ca(2+) affinity depending on the pH, thereby promoting fast ligand release.},

My thoughts: 
Suggests that Arrestins are important to signalling. Two general possibilities come to mind
1) Arrestins are needed for signalling because they actually have signalling roles (still unsuported but what they want to say) 
2) Arrestins may stabilize GPCRs and without them there's loss of GPCRs which results in reduced signalling output

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) use diverse mechanisms to regulate the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2. $\beta$-Arrestins ($\beta$Arr1/2) are ubiquitous inhibitors of G protein signaling, promoting GPCR desensitization and internalization and serving as scaffolds for ERK1/2 activation. Studies using CRISPR/Cas9 to delete $\beta$Arr1/2 and G proteins have cast doubt on the role of $\beta$-arrestins in activating specific pools of ERK1/2. We compared the effects of siRNA-mediated knockdown of $\beta$Arr1/2 and reconstitution with $\beta$Arr1/2 in three different parental and CRISPR-derived $\beta$Arr1/2 knockout HEK293 cell pairs to assess the effect of $\beta$Arr1/2 deletion on ERK1/2 activation by four Gs-coupled GPCRs. In all parental lines with all receptors, ERK1/2 stimulation was reduced by siRNAs specific for $\beta$Arr2 or $\beta$Arr1/2. In contrast, variable effects were observed with CRISPR-derived cell lines both between different lines and with activation of different receptors. For $\beta$2 adrenergic receptors ($\beta$2ARs) and $\beta$1ARs, $\beta$Arr1/2 deletion increased, decreased, or had no effect on isoproterenol-stimulated ERK1/2 activation in different CRISPR clones. ERK1/2 activation by the vasopressin V2 and follicle-stimulating hormone receptors was reduced in these cells but was enhanced by reconstitution with $\beta$Arr1/2. Loss of desensitization and receptor internalization in CRISPR $\beta$Arr1/2 knockout cells caused $\beta$2AR-mediated stimulation of ERK1/2 to become more dependent on G proteins, which was reversed by reintroducing $\beta$Arr1/2. These data suggest that $\beta$Arr1/2 function as a regulatory hub, determining the balance between mechanistically different pathways that result in activation of ERK1/2, and caution against extrapolating results obtained from $\beta$Arr1/2- or G protein-deleted cells to GPCR behavior in native systems.},

abstract = {Most members of the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) superfamily hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate (GTP) quite slowly unless stimulated by a GTPase activating protein or GAP. The alpha subunits (G alpha) of the heterotrimeric G proteins hydrolyze GTP much more rapidly and contain an approximately 120-residue insert not found in other GTPases. Interactions between a G alpha insert domain and a G alpha GTP-binding core domain, both expressed as recombinant proteins, show that the insert acts biochemically as a GAP. The results suggest a general mechanism for GAP-dependent hydrolysis of GTP by other GTPases.},

abstract = {Noncovalent interactions are of fundamental importance across the disciplines of chemistry, materials science, and biology. Quantum chemical calculations on noncovalently bound complexes, which allow for the quantification of properties such as binding energies and geometries, play an essential role in advancing our understanding of, and building models for, a vast array of complex processes involving molecular association or self-assembly. Because of its relatively modest computational cost, second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation (MP2) theory is one of the most widely used methods in quantum chemistry for studying noncovalent interactions. MP2 is, however, plagued by serious errors due to its incomplete treatment of electron correlation, especially when modeling van der Waals interactions and $\pi$-stacked complexes. Here we present spin-network-scaled MP2 (SNS-MP2), a new semi-empirical MP2-based method for dimer interaction-energy calculations. To correct for errors in MP2, SNS-MP2 uses quantum chemical features of the complex under study in conjunction with a neural network to reweight terms appearing in the total MP2 interaction energy. The method has been trained on a new data set consisting of over 200 000 complete basis set (CBS)-extrapolated coupled-cluster interaction energies, which are considered the gold standard for chemical accuracy. SNS-MP2 predicts gold-standard binding energies of unseen test compounds with a mean absolute error of 0.04 kcal mol-1 (root-mean-square error 0.09 kcal mol-1), a 6- to 7-fold improvement over MP2. To the best of our knowledge, its accuracy exceeds that of all extant density functional theory- and wavefunction-based methods of similar computational cost, and is very close to the intrinsic accuracy of our benchmark coupled-cluster methodology itself. Furthermore, SNS-MP2 provides reliable per-conformation confidence intervals on the predicted interaction energies, a feature not available from any alternative method.},

abstract = {Allosteric transitions are one of the subtler mechanisms used by nature to fine tune protein activity. Effector binding to a specific site on the protein surface induces significant activity change, and initiates a conformational transition that frequently includes domain motions and is very large. From a theoretical and biophysical perspective two problems are particularly intriguing. The first is the way in which a launching signal, which is spatially confined and includes only a few interacting atoms, is propagated to a large-scale conformational transition we frequently see in allosteric transitions. Hence, there is the question of how a small perturbation is magnified to yield motions of thousands of atoms. The second puzzle is of focus, coherence, and efficiency. The impact of the binding of the effector is sometimes extended over tens of angstroms. How the signal is transmitted and kept significant over such large distances in the 'noisy' molecular environment is another major direction of investigation. In the present review we examined different theoretical and computational attempts to solve the questions.},

abstract = {A long-standing challenge is to understand at the atomic level how protein dynamics contribute to enzyme catalysis. X-ray crystallography can provide snapshots of conformational substates sampled during enzymatic reactions, while NMR relaxation methods reveal the rates of interconversion between substates and the corresponding relative populations. However, these current methods cannot simultaneously reveal the detailed atomic structures of the rare states and rationalize the finding that intrinsic motions in the free enzyme occur on a timescale similar to the catalytic turnover rate. Here we introduce dual strategies of ambient-temperature X-ray crystallographic data collection and automated electron-density sampling to structurally unravel interconverting substates of the human proline isomerase, cyclophilin A (CYPA, also known as PPIA). A conservative mutation outside the active site was designed to stabilize features of the previously hidden minor conformation. This mutation not only inverts the equilibrium between the substates, but also causes large, parallel reductions in the conformational interconversion rates and the catalytic rate. These studies introduce crystallographic approaches to define functional minor protein conformations and, in combination with NMR analysis of the enzyme dynamics in solution, show how collective motions directly contribute to the catalytic power of an enzyme.},

abstract = {The evolutionary histories of complex traits are complicated because such traits are comprised of multiple integrated and interacting components, which may have different individual histories. Phylogenetic studies of complex trait evolution often do not take this into account, instead focusing only on the history of whole, integrated traits; for example, mapping eyes as simply present or absent through history. Using the biochemistry of animal vision as a model, we demonstrate how investigating the individual components of complex systems can aid in elucidating both the origins and diversification of such systems. Opsin-based phototransduction underlies all visual phenotypes in animals, using complex protein cascades that translate light information into changes in cyclic nucleotide gated (CNG) or canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) ion-channel activity. Here we show that CNG ion channels play a role in cnidarian phototransduction. Transcripts of a CNG ion channel co-localize with opsin in specific cell types of the eyeless cnidarian Hydra magnipapillata. Further, the CNG inhibitor cis-diltiazem ablates a stereotypical photoresponse in the hydra. Our findings in the Cnidaria, the only non-bilaterian lineage to possess functional opsins, allow us to trace the history of CNG-based photosensitivity to the very origin of animal phototransduction. Our general analytical approach, based on explicit phylogenetic analysis of individual components, contrasts the deep evolutionary history of CNG-based phototransduction, today used in vertebrate vision, with the more recent assembly of TRPC-based systems that are common to protostome (e.g. fly and mollusc) vision.},

This theory proposes that the activation of olfactory G protein-coupled receptors occurs by an inelastic electron tunneling mechanism that is mediated through the presence of an agonist with an appropriate vibrational state to accept the inelastic portion of the tunneling electron's energy. In a recent series of papers, some suggestive theoretical evidence has been offered that this theory may be applied to nonolfactory G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including those associated with the central nervous system (CNS). [Chee HK, June OS (2013) Genomics Inform 11(4):282-288; Chee HK, et al. (2015) FEBS Lett 589(4):548-552; Oh SJ (2012) Genomics Inform 10(2):128-132]. Herein, we test the viability of this idea, both by receptor affinity and receptor activation measured by calcium flux. This test was performed using a pair of well-characterized agonists for members of the 5-HT2 class of serotonin receptors, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) and N,N-dimethyllysergamide (DAM-57), and their respective deuterated isotopologues. No evidence was found that selective deuteration affected either the binding affinity or the activation by the selected ligands for the examined members of the 5-HT2 receptor class.},

This structure emerges from spatial correlations of dynamics that appear in disordered systems as they approach nonergodic or jammed states. It is characterized in terms of dynamical heterogeneity, facilitation, and excitation lines. These features are associated with a newly discovered class of nonequilibrium phase transitions. Equilibrium properties have little, if anything, to do with it. The broken symmetries of these transitions are obscure or absent in spatial structures, but they are vivid in space-time (i.e., trajectory space). In our view, the glass transition is an example of this class of transitions. The basic ideas and principles we review were originally developed through the analysis of idealized and abstract models. Nevertheless, the central ideas are easily illustrated with reference to molecular dynamics of more realistic atomistic models, and we use that illustrative approach here.},

abstract = {Complex networks of interacting residues and microdomains in the structures of biomolecular systems underlie the reliable propagation of information from an input signal, such as the concentration of a ligand, to sites that generate the appropriate output signal, such as enzymatic activity. This information transduction often carries the signal across relatively large distances at the molecular scale in a form of allostery that is essential for the physiological functions performed by biomolecules. While allosteric behaviors have been documented from experiments and computation, the mechanism of this form of allostery proved difficult to identify at the molecular level. Here, we introduce a novel analysis framework, called N-body Information Theory (NbIT) analysis, which is based on information theory and uses measures of configurational entropy in a biomolecular system to identify microdomains and individual residues that act as (i)-channels for long-distance information sharing between functional sites, and (ii)-coordinators that organize dynamics within functional sites. Application of the new method to molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of the occluded state of the bacterial leucine transporter LeuT identifies a channel of allosteric coupling between the functionally important intracellular gate and the substrate binding sites known to modulate it. NbIT analysis is shown also to differentiate residues involved primarily in stabilizing the functional sites, from those that contribute to allosteric couplings between sites. NbIT analysis of MD data thus reveals rigorous mechanistic elements of allostery underlying the dynamics of biomolecular systems.},

abstract = {Lipid phase heterogeneity in the plasma membrane is thought to be crucial for many aspects of cell signaling, but the physical basis of participating membrane domains such as "lipid rafts" remains controversial. Here we consider a lattice model yielding a phase diagram that includes several states proposed to be relevant for the cell membrane, including microemulsion-which can be related to membrane curvature-and Ising critical behavior. Using a neural-network-based machine learning approach, we compute the full phase diagram of this lattice model. We analyze selected regions of this phase diagram in the context of a signaling initiation event in mast cells: recruitment of the membrane-anchored tyrosine kinase Lyn to a cluster of transmembrane IgE-Fc$\varepsilon$RI receptors. We find that model membrane systems in microemulsion and Ising critical states can mediate roughly equal levels of kinase recruitment (binding energy ∼ -0.6 kBT), whereas a membrane near a tricritical point can mediate a much stronger kinase recruitment (-1.7 kBT). By comparing several models for lipid heterogeneity within a single theoretical framework, this work points to testable differences between existing models. We also suggest the tricritical point as a new possibility for the basis of membrane domains that facilitate preferential partitioning of signaling components.},

abstract = {Allostery represents a fundamental mechanism of biological regulation that is mediated via long-range communication between distant protein sites. Although little is known about the underlying dynamical process, recent time-resolved infrared spectroscopy experiments on a photoswitchable PDZ domain (PDZ2S) have indicated that the allosteric transition occurs on multiple timescales. Here, using extensive nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, a time-dependent picture of the allosteric communication in PDZ2S is developed. The simulations reveal that allostery amounts to the propagation of structural and dynamical changes that are genuinely nonlinear and can occur in a nonlocal fashion. A dynamic network model is constructed that illustrates the hierarchy and exceeding structural heterogeneity of the process. In compelling agreement with experiment, three physically distinct phases of the time evolution are identified, describing elastic response ([Formula: see text] ns), inelastic reorganization ([Formula: see text] ns), and structural relaxation ([Formula: see text]s). Issues such as the similarity to downhill folding as well as the interpretation of allosteric pathways are discussed.},

Here we present an approach to characterize intramolecular network structure using NMR chemical shift perturbations. We apply the method to the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38$\gamma$. p38$\gamma$ contains allosteric sites that are conserved among eukaryotic kinases as well as unique to the MAPK family. How these regulatory sites communicate with catalytic residues is not well understood. Using our method, we observe and characterize for the first time information flux between regulatory sites through a conserved kinase infrastructure. This network is accessed, reinforced, and broken in various states of p38$\gamma$, reflecting the functional state of the protein. We demonstrate that the approach detects critical junctions in the network corresponding to biologically significant allosteric sites and pathways.},

Here, we analyze the fitness effects of all single mutations in TEM-1 $\beta$-lactamase (4,997 variants) under selection for the wild-type function (ampicillin resistance) and for a new function (cefotaxime resistance). Tolerance to mutation in this enzyme is bimodal and dependent on the strength of purifying selection in vivo, a result that derives from a steep non-linear ampicillin-dependent relationship between biochemical activity and fitness. Interestingly, cefotaxime resistance emerges from mutations that are neutral at low levels of ampicillin but deleterious at high levels; thus the capacity to evolve new function also depends on the strength of selection. The key property controlling evolvability is an excess of enzymatic activity relative to the strength of selection, suggesting that fluctuating environments might select for high-activity enzymes.},

abstract = {Understanding of protein conformational dynamics is essential for elucidating molecular origins of protein structure-function relationship. Traditionally, reaction coordinates, i.e., some functions of protein atom positions and velocities have been used to interpret the complex dynamics of proteins obtained from experimental and computational approaches such as molecular dynamics simulations. However, it is nontrivial to identify the reaction coordinates a priori even for small proteins. Here, we evaluate the power of evolutionary couplings (ECs) to capture protein dynamics by exploring their use as reaction coordinates, which can efficiently guide the sampling of a conformational free energy landscape. We have analyzed 10 diverse proteins and shown that a few ECs are sufficient to characterize complex conformational dynamics of proteins involved in folding and conformational change processes. With the rapid strides in sequencing technology, we expect that ECs could help identify reaction coordinates a priori and enhance the sampling of the slow dynamical process associated with protein folding and conformational change.},

abstract = {Adaptation of organisms to environmental niches is a hallmark of evolution. One prevalent example is that of thermal adaptation, in which two descendants evolve at different temperature extremes1,2. Underlying the physiological differences between such organisms are changes in enzymes that catalyse essential reactions 3 , with orthologues from each organism undergoing adaptive mutations that preserve similar catalytic rates at their respective physiological temperatures4,5. The sequence changes responsible for these adaptive differences, however, are often at surface-exposed sites distant from the substrate-binding site, leaving the active site of the enzyme structurally unperturbed6,7. How such changes are allosterically propagated to the active site, to modulate activity, is not known. Here we show that entropy-tuning changes can be engineered into distal sites of Escherichia coli adenylate kinase, allowing us to quantitatively assess the role of dynamics in determining affinity, turnover and the role in driving adaptation. The results not only reveal a dynamics-based allosteric tuning mechanism, but also uncover a spatial separation of the control of key enzymatic parameters. Fluctuations in one mobile domain (the LID) control substrate affinity, whereas dynamic attenuation in the other domain (the AMP-binding domain) affects rate-limiting conformational changes that govern enzyme turnover. Dynamics-based regulation may thus represent an elegant, widespread and previously unrealized evolutionary adaptation mechanism that fine-tunes biological function without altering the ground state structure. Furthermore, because rigid-body conformational changes in both domains were thought to be rate limiting for turnover8,9, these adaptation studies reveal a new model for understanding the relationship between dynamics and turnover in adenylate kinase.},

abstract = {Although the biochemical pathways for the anaerobic degradation of many of the hydrocarbon constituents in petroleum reservoirs have been elucidated, the mechanisms for anaerobic activation of benzene, a very stable molecule, are not known. Previous studies have demonstrated that Geobacter metallireducens can anaerobically oxidize benzene to carbon dioxide with Fe(III) as the sole electron acceptor and that phenol is an intermediate in benzene oxidation. In an attempt to identify enzymes that might be involved in the conversion of benzene to phenol, whole-genome gene transcript abundance was compared in cells metabolizing benzene and cells metabolizing phenol. Eleven genes had significantly higher transcript abundance in benzene-metabolizing cells. Five of these genes had annotations suggesting that they did not encode proteins that could be involved in benzene metabolism and were not further studied. Strains were constructed in which one of the remaining six genes was deleted. The strain in which the monocistronic gene Gmet 0232 was deleted metabolized phenol, but not benzene. Transcript abundance of the adjacent monocistronic gene, Gmet 0231, predicted to encode a zinc-containing oxidoreductase, was elevated in cells metabolizing benzene, although not at a statistically significant level. However, deleting Gmet 0231 also yielded a strain that could metabolize phenol, but not benzene. Although homologs of Gmet 0231 and Gmet 0232 are found in microorganisms not known to anaerobically metabolize benzene, the adjacent localization of these genes is unique to G. metallireducens. The discovery of genes that are specifically required for the metabolism of benzene, but not phenol in G. metallireducens is an important step in potentially identifying the mechanisms for anaerobic benzene activation.},

abstract = {Aromatic compounds are widely distributed in nature and can only be biomineralized by microorganisms. In anaerobic bacteria, benzoyl-CoA (BCoA) is a central intermediate of aromatic degradation, and serves as substrate for dearomatizing BCoA reductases (BCRs). In facultative anaerobes, the mechanistically difficult reduction of BCoA to cyclohexa-1,5-dienoyl-1-carboxyl-CoA (dienoyl-CoA) is driven by a stoichiometric ATP hydrolysis, catalyzed by a soluble, three [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing BCR. In this work, an in vitro assay for BCR from the obligately anaerobic Geobacter metallireducens was established. It followed the reverse reaction, the formation of BCoA from dienoyl-CoA in the presence of various electron acceptors. The benzoate-induced activity was highly specific for dienoyl-CoA (K(m) = 24 +/- 4 microM). The corresponding oxygen-sensitive enzyme was purified by several chromatographic steps with a 115-fold enrichment and a yield of 18%. The 185-kDa enzyme comprised 73- and 20-kDa subunits, suggesting an alpha(2)beta(2)-composition. MS analysis revealed the subunits as products of the benzoate-induced bamBC genes. The alphabeta unit contained 0.9 W, 15 Fe, and 12.5 acid-labile sulfur. Results from EPR spectroscopy suggest the presence of one [3Fe-4S](0/+1) and three [4Fe-4S](+1/+2) clusters per alphabeta unit; oxidized BamBC exhibited an EPR signal typical for a W(V) species. The FeS clusters and the W- cofactor could only be fully reduced by dienoyl-CoA. BamBC represents the prototype of a previously undescribed class of dearomatizing BCRs that differ completely from the ATP-dependent enzymes from facultative anaerobes.},

abstract = {Historically it has been virtually impossible to experimentally determine the contribution of residual protein entropy to fundamental protein activities such as the binding of ligands. Recent progress has illuminated the possibility of employing NMR relaxation methods to quantitatively determine the role of changes in conformational entropy in molecular recognition by proteins. The method rests on using fast internal protein dynamics as a proxy. Initial results reveal a large and variable role for conformational entropy in the binding of ligands by proteins. Such a role for conformational entropy in molecular recognition has significant implications for enzymology, signal transduction, allosteric regulation and the development of protein-directed pharmaceuticals.},

abstract = {A number of modern sampling methods probe long time behavior in complex biomolecules using a set of relatively short trajectory segments. Markov state models (MSMs) can be useful in analyzing such data sets, but in particularly complex landscapes, the available trajectory data may prove insufficient for constructing valid Markov models. Here, we explore the potential utility of history-dependent analyses applied to relatively poor decompositions of configuration space for which MSMs are inadequate. Our approaches build on previous work [Suarez et. al., JCTC 2014] showing that, with sufficient history information, unbiased equilibrium and non-equilibrium observables can be obtained even for arbitrary non-Markovian divisions of phase space. We explore a range of non-Markovian approximations using varying amounts of history information to model the finite length of trajectory segments, applying the analyses to toy models as well as several proteins previously studied by microsec-milisec scale atomistic simulations [Lindorff-Larsen et. al., Science 2011].},

abstract = {G protein alpha subunits consist of two domains, a GTPase domain and a helical domain. Receptors activate G proteins by catalyzing replacement of GDP, which is buried between these two domains, with GTP. Substitution of the homologous alphai2 residues for four alphas residues in switch III, a region that changes conformation upon GTP binding, or of one nearby helical domain residue decreases the ability of alphas to be activated by the beta-adrenergic receptor and by aluminum fluoride. Both sets of mutations increase the affinity of alphas for the beta-adrenergic receptor, based on an increased amount of high affinity binding of the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol. The mutations also decrease the rate of receptor-mediated activation and disrupt the ability of the beta-adrenergic receptor to increase the apparent affinity of alphas for the GTP analog, guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). Simultaneous replacement of the helical domain residue and one of the four switch III residues with the homologous alphai2 residues restores normal receptor-mediated activation, suggesting that the defects caused by mutations at the domain interface are due to altered interdomain interactions. These results suggest that interactions between residues across the domain interface are involved in two key steps of receptor-mediated activation, promotion of GTP binding and subsequent receptor-G protein dissociation.},

abstract = {Oligomerization is a functional requirement for many proteins. The interfacial interactions and the overall packing geometry of the individual monomers are viewed as important determinants of the thermodynamic stability and allosteric regulation of oligomers. The present study focuses on the role of the interfacial interactions and overall contact topology in the dynamic features acquired in the oligomeric state. To this aim, the collective dynamics of enzymes belonging to the amino acid kinase family both in dimeric and hexameric forms are examined by means of an elastic network model, and the softest collective motions (i.e., lowest frequency or global modes of motions) favored by the overall architecture are analyzed. Notably, the lowest-frequency modes accessible to the individual subunits in the absence of multimerization are conserved to a large extent in the oligomer, suggesting that the oligomer takes advantage of the intrinsic dynamics of the individual monomers. At the same time, oligomerization stiffens the interfacial regions of the monomers and confers new cooperative modes that exploit the rigid-body translational and rotational degrees of freedom of the intact monomers. The present study sheds light on the mechanism of cooperative inhibition of hexameric N-acetyl-L-glutamate kinase by arginine and on the allosteric regulation of UMP kinases. It also highlights the significance of the particular quaternary design in selectively determining the oligomer dynamics congruent with required ligand-binding and allosteric activities.},

Use of B-splines in place of Lagrange interpolation leads to analytic gradients as well as a significant improvement in the accuracy. We demonstrate that arbitrary accuracy can be achieved, independent of system size N, at a cost that scales as N log(N). For biomolecular systems with many thousands of atoms this method permits the use of Ewald summation at a computational cost comparable to that of a simple truncation method of 10 {\AA} or less.},

Straightforward molecular dynamics and replica exchange methods both have severe convergence problems, whereas transition path sampling allows us to sample unbiased dynamical pathways between folded and unfolded states and leads to deeper understanding of the mechanisms of (un)folding. In contrast to previous predictions employing an implicit solvent, we find that Trp-cage folds primarily (80% of the paths) via a pathway forming the tertiary contacts and the salt bridge, before helix formation. The remaining 20% of the paths occur in the opposite order, by first forming the helix. The transition states of the rate-limiting steps are solvated native-like structures. Water expulsion is found to be the last step upon folding for each route. Committor analysis suggests that the dynamics of the solvent is not part of the reaction coordinate. Nevertheless, during the transition, specific water molecules are strongly bound and can play a structural role in the folding.},

abstract = {Allosteric effects often underlie the activity of proteins, and elucidating generic design aspects and functional principles unique to allosteric phenomena represent a major challenge. Here an approach consisting of the in~silico design of synthetic structures, which, as the principal element of allostery, encode dynamical long-range coupling among two sites, is presented. The structures are represented by elastic networks, similar to coarse-grained models of real proteins. A strategy of evolutionary optimization was implemented to iteratively improve allosteric coupling. In the designed structures, allosteric interactions were analyzed in terms of strain propagation, and simple pathways that emerged during evolution were identified as signatures through which long-range communication was established. Moreover, robustness of allosteric performance with respect to mutations was demonstrated. As it turned out, the designed prototype structures reveal dynamical properties resembling those found in real allosteric proteins. Hence, they may serve as toy models of complex allosteric systems, such as proteins. Application of the developed modeling scheme to the allosteric transition in the myosin V molecular motor was also demonstrated.},

abstract = {Sequences and available structures were compared for all the widely distributed representatives of the P-loop GTPases and GTPase-related proteins with the aim of constructing an evolutionary classification for this superclass of proteins and reconstructing the principal events in their evolution. The GTPase superclass can be divided into two large classes, each of which has a unique set of sequence and structural signatures (synapomorphies). The first class, designated TRAFAC (after translation factors) includes enzymes involved in translation (initiation, elongation, and release factors), signal transduction (in particular, the extended Ras-like family), cell motility, and intracellular transport. The second class, designated SIMIBI (after signal recognition particle, MinD, and BioD), consists of signal recognition particle (SRP) GTPases, the assemblage of MinD-like ATPases, which are involved in protein localization, chromosome partitioning, and membrane transport, and a group of metabolic enzymes with kinase or related phosphate transferase activity. These two classes together contain over 20 distinct families that are further subdivided into 57 subfamilies (ancient lineages) on the basis of conserved sequence motifs, shared structural features, and domain architectures. Ten subfamilies show a universal phyletic distribution compatible with presence in the last universal common ancestor of the extant life forms (LUCA). These include four translation factors, two OBG-like GTPases, the YawG/YlqF-like GTPases (these two subfamilies also consist of predicted translation factors), the two signal-recognition-associated GTPases, and the MRP subfamily of MinD-like ATPases. The distribution of nucleotide specificity among the proteins of the GTPase superclass indicates that the common ancestor of the entire superclass was a GTPase and that a secondary switch to ATPase activity has occurred on several independent occasions during evolution. The functions of most GTPases that are traceable to LUCA are associated with translation. However, in contrast to other superclasses of P-loop NTPases (RecA-F1/F0, AAA+, helicases, ABC), GTPases do not participate in NTP-dependent nucleic acid unwinding and reorganizing activities. Hence, we hypothesize that the ancestral GTPase was an enzyme with a generic regulatory role in translation, with subsequent diversification resulting in acquisition of diverse functions in transport, protein trafficking, and signaling. In addition to the classification of previously known families of GTPases and related ATPases, we introduce several previously undetected families and describe new functional predictions.},

abstract = {Signaling of the prototypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) rhodopsin through its cognate G protein transducin (Gt) is quenched when arrestin binds to the activated receptor. Although the overall architecture of the rhodopsin/arrestin complex is known, many questions regarding its specificity remain unresolved. Here, using FTIR difference spectroscopy and a dual pH/peptide titration assay, we show that rhodopsin maintains certain flexibility upon binding the "finger loop" of visual arrestin (prepared as synthetic peptide ArrFL-1). We found that two distinct complexes can be stabilized depending on the protonation state of E3.49 in the conserved (D)ERY motif. Both complexes exhibit different interaction modes and affinities of ArrFL-1 binding. The plasticity of the receptor within the rhodopsin/ArrFL-1 complex stands in contrast to the complex with the C terminus of the Gt$\alpha$-subunit (G$\alpha$CT), which stabilizes only one specific substate out of the conformational ensemble. However, Gt$\alpha$-subunit binding and both ArrFL-1-binding modes involve a direct interaction to conserved R3.50, as determined by site-directed mutagenesis. Our findings highlight the importance of receptor conformational flexibility and cytoplasmic proton uptake for modulation of rhodopsin signaling and thereby extend the picture provided by crystal structures of the rhodopsin/arrestin and rhodopsin/ArrFL-1 complexes. Furthermore, the two binding modes of ArrFL-1 identified here involve motifs of conserved amino acids, which indicates that our results may have elucidated a common modulation mechanism of class A GPCR-G protein/-arrestin signaling.},

abstract = {Molecular communication in biology is mediated by protein interactions. According to the current paradigm, the specificity and affinity required for these interactions are encoded in the precise complementarity of binding interfaces. Even proteins that are disordered under physiological conditions or that contain large unstructured regions commonly interact with well-structured binding sites on other biomolecules. Here we demonstrate the existence of an unexpected interaction mechanism: the two intrinsically disordered human proteins histone H1 and its nuclear chaperone prothymosin-$\alpha$ associate in a complex with picomolar affinity, but fully retain their structural disorder, long-range flexibility and highly dynamic character. On the basis of closely integrated experiments and molecular simulations, we show that the interaction can be explained by the large opposite net charge of the two proteins, without requiring defined binding sites or interactions between specific individual residues. Proteome-wide sequence analysis suggests that this interaction mechanism may be abundant in eukaryotes.},

A mutational analysis of c-Src expressed in Schizosaccharomyces pombe demonstrates that replacement of residues in the SH2-SH3 connector with glycine activates c-Src. The SH2-SH3 connector appears to be an inducible "snap lock" that clamps the SH2 and SH3 domains upon tail phosphorylation, but which allows flexibility when the tail is released.},

abstract = {Nearly 20 years ago, transition path sampling (TPS) emerged as an alternative method to free energy based approaches for the study of rare events such as nucleation, protein folding, chemical reactions, and phase transitions. TPS effectively performs Monte Carlo simulations with relatively short molecular dynamics trajectories, with the advantage of not having to alter the actual potential energy surface nor the underlying physical dynamics. Although the TPS approach also introduced a methodology to compute reaction rates, this approach was for a long time considered theoretically attractive, providing the exact same results as extensively long molecular dynamics simulations, but still expensive for most relevant applications. With the increase of computer power and improvements in the algorithmic methodology, quantitative path sampling is finding applications in more and more areas of research. In particular, the transition interface sampling (TIS) and the replica exchange TIS (RETIS) algorithms have, in turn, improved the efficiency of quantitative path sampling significantly, while maintaining the exact nature of the approach. Also, open-source software packages are making these methods, for which implementation is not straightforward, now available for a wider group of users. In addition, a blooming development takes place regarding both applications and algorithmic refinements. Therefore, it is timely to explore the wide panorama of the new developments in this field. This is the aim of this article, which focuses on the most efficient exact path sampling approach, RETIS, as well as its recent applications, extensions, and variations.},

Here we present the 3.5 {\AA} resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the $\mu$OR bound to the agonist peptide DAMGO and nucleotide-free Gi. DAMGO occupies the morphinan ligand pocket, with its N~terminus interacting with conserved receptor residues and its C~terminus engaging regions important for opioid-ligand selectivity. Comparison of the $\mu$OR{\textendash}Gi complex to previously determined structures of other GPCRs bound to the stimulatory G protein Gs reveals differences in the position of transmembrane receptor helix 6 and in the interactions between the G protein $\alpha$-subunit and the receptor core. Together, these results shed light on the structural features that contribute to the Gi protein-coupling specificity of the {\textmu}OR.},

abstract = {Allostery represents a fundamental mechanism of biological regulation that is mediated via long-range communication between distant protein sites. Although little is known about the underlying dynamical process, recent time-resolved infrared spectroscopy experiments on a photoswitchable PDZ domain (PDZ2S) have indicated that the allosteric transition occurs on multiple timescales. Here, using extensive nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, a time-dependent picture of the allosteric communication in PDZ2S is developed. The simulations reveal that allostery amounts to the propagation of structural and dynamical changes that are genuinely nonlinear and can occur in a nonlocal fashion. A dynamic network model is constructed that illustrates the hierarchy and exceeding structural heterogeneity of the process. In compelling agreement with experiment, three physically distinct phases of the time evolution are identified, describing elastic response ([Formula: see text] ns), inelastic reorganization ([Formula: see text] ns), and structural relaxation ([Formula: see text]s). Issues such as the similarity to downhill folding as well as the interpretation of allosteric pathways are discussed.},

abstract = {G-protein-coupled receptors mediate the biological effects of many hormones and neurotransmitters and are important pharmacological targets. They transmit their signals to the cell interior by interacting with G proteins. However, it is unclear how receptors and G proteins meet, interact and couple. Here we analyse the concerted motion of G-protein-coupled receptors and G proteins on the plasma membrane and provide a quantitative model that reveals the key factors that underlie the high spatiotemporal complexity of their interactions. Using two-colour, single-molecule imaging we visualize interactions between individual receptors and G proteins at the surface of living cells. Under basal conditions, receptors and G proteins form activity-dependent complexes that last for around one second. Agonists specifically regulate the kinetics of receptor-G protein interactions, mainly by increasing their association rate. We find hot spots on the plasma membrane, at least partially defined by the cytoskeleton and clathrin-coated pits, in which receptors and G proteins are confined and preferentially couple. Imaging with the nanobody Nb37 suggests that signalling by G-protein-coupled receptors occurs preferentially at these hot spots. These findings shed new light on the dynamic interactions that control G-protein-coupled receptor signalling.},

abstract = {Heterotrimeric G proteins play a pivotal role in the signal-transduction pathways initiated by G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation. Agonist-receptor binding causes GDP-to-GTP exchange and dissociation of the G$\alpha$ subunit from the heterotrimeric G protein, leading to downstream signaling. Here, we studied the internal mobility of a G-protein $\alpha$ subunit in its apo and nucleotide-bound forms and characterized their dynamical features at multiple time scales using solution NMR, small-angle X-ray scattering, and molecular dynamics simulations. We find that binding of GTP analogs leads to a rigid and closed arrangement of the G$\alpha$ subdomain, whereas the apo and GDP-bound forms are considerably more open and dynamic. Furthermore, we were able to detect two conformational states of the G$\alpha$ Ras domain in slow exchange whose populations are regulated by binding to nucleotides and a GPCR. One of these conformational states, the open state, binds to the GPCR; the second conformation, the closed state, shows no interaction with the receptor. Binding to the GPCR stabilizes the open state. This study provides an in-depth analysis of the conformational landscape and the switching function of a G-protein $\alpha$ subunit and the influence of a GPCR in that landscape.},

These deep neural networks were trained on essentially all reactions ever published in organic chemistry. Our system solves for almost twice as many molecules, thirty times faster than the traditional computer-aided search method, which is based on extracted rules and hand-designed heuristics.

abstract = {<p>G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate multiple signaling pathways in the cell depending on the agonist that activates the receptor and multiple cellular factors. Agonists that show higher potency to specific signaling pathways over others are known as "biased agonists" and have been shown to have better therapeutic index. Although biased agonists are desirable, their design poses several challenges to date. The number of assays to identify biased agonists seems expensive and tedious. Therefore, computational methods that can reliably calculate the possible bias of various ligands ahead of experiments and provide guidance will be both cost and time effective. In this work, using the mechanism of allosteric communication from the extracellular region to the intracellular transducer protein coupling region in GPCRs, we have developed a computational method, to calculate ligand bias ahead of experiments. We have validated the method for several $\beta$-arrestin biased agonists in $\beta$2-adrenergic receptor, serotonin receptors 5HT1B and 5HT2B and for G-protein biased agonists in the $\kappa$-opioid receptor. Using this computational method, we also performed a blind prediction followed by experimental testing and showed that the agonist carmoterol is $\beta$-arrestin biased in $\beta$2-adrenergic receptor. Additionally, we have identified amino acid residues in the biased agonist binding site in both $\beta$2-adrenergic and $\kappa$-opioid receptors that are involved in potentiating the ligand bias. We call these residues as "functional hotspots" and they can be used to derive pharmacophores to design biased agonists in GPCRs.</p>},

abstract = {We construct coarse master equations for peptide folding dynamics from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. A maximum-likelihood propagator-based method allows us to extract accurate rates for the transitions between the different conformational states of the small helix-forming peptide Ala5. Assigning the conformational states by using transition paths instead of instantaneous molecular coordinates suppresses the effects of fast non-Markovian dynamics. The resulting master equations are validated by comparing their analytical correlation functions with those obtained directly from the molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the master equations properly capture the character and relaxation times of the entire spectrum of conformational relaxation processes. By using the eigenvectors of the transition rate matrix, we are able to systematically coarse-grain the system. We find that a two-state description, with a folded and an unfolded state, roughly captures the slow conformational dynamics. A f...},

abstract = {A computational technique is proposed which combines the string method with a sampling technique to determine minimum free energy paths. The technique only requires to compute the mean force and another conditional expectation locally along the string, and therefore can be applied even if the number of collective variables kept in the free energy calculation is large. This is in contrast with other free energy sampling techniques which aim at mapping the full free energy landscape and whose cost increases exponentially with the number of collective variables kept in the free energy. Provided that the number of collective variables is large enough, the new technique captures the mechanism of transition in that it allows to determine the committor function for the reaction and, in particular, the transition state region. The new technique is illustrated on the example of alanine dipeptide, in which we compute the minimum free energy path for the isomerization transition using either two or four dihedral angles as collective variables. It is shown that the mechanism of transition can be captured using the four dihedral angles, but it cannot be captured using only two of them.},

abstract = {Allosteric (i.e. long-range) communication within proteins is crucial for many biological processes, such as the activation of signaling cascades in response to specific stimuli. However, the physical basis for this communication remains unclear. Existing computational methods for identifying allostery focus on the role of concerted structural changes, but recent experimental work demonstrates that disorder is also an important factor. Here, we introduce the Correlation of All Rotameric and Dynamical States (CARDS) framework for quantifying correlations between both the structure and disorder of different regions of a protein. To quantify disorder, we draw inspiration from methods for quantifying "dynamic heterogeneity" from chemical physics to classify segments of a dihedral's time evolution as being in either ordered or disordered regimes. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we apply CARDS to the Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP), a transcriptional activator that is regulated by Cyclic Adenosine MonoPhosphate (cAMP) binding. We find that CARDS captures allosteric communication between the two cAMP-Binding Domains (CBDs) that NMR experiments have established occurs without a concerted structural change. CARDS also recapitulates an enhanced role for disorder in the communication between the DNA-Binding Domains (DBDs) and CBDs in the S62F variant of CAP. Finally, we demonstrate that using CARDS to find communication hotspots automatically identifies regions of CAP that are in allosteric communication without foreknowledge of their identities. Therefore, we expect CARDS to be of great utility for both understanding and predicting allostery.},

abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the most important contaminants of groundwater. The 2- and 3-ring PAHs are of particular concern because they are water soluble in the 1-200 mug/l range and are transported with the groundwater over significant distances. Anaerobic degradation of PAH has been demonstrated in several microcosm studies with nitrate, ferric iron, or sulfate as electron acceptors and under methanogenic conditions. The biochemical degradation pathways were studied with naphthalene-degrading pure and enrichment cultures and revealed that 2-naphthoic acid is a central metabolite. Naphthalene is activated by addition of a C(1)-unit to generate 2-naphthoic acid, whereas methylnaphthalene is activated by addition of fumarate to the methyl group and further degraded to 2-naphthoic acid. In the central 2-naphthoic acid degradation pathway the ring system is reduced prior to ring cleavage generating e.g. 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acid. The ring cleavage produces metabolites such as 2-carboxycyclohexylacetic acid indicating that further degradation goes via cyclohexane derivatives and not via aromatic compounds. Anaerobic degradation of PAH has also been demonstrated in situ in contaminated aquifers by identification of compound specific metabolites and using stable isotope fraction studies. Detection of specific metabolites of anaerobic PAH degradation such as naphthyl-2-methylsuccinate indicated anaerobic degradation of 2-methylnaphthalene in situ whereas 2-naphthoic acid was indicative of naphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene degradation. Other carboxylic acids that were detected in groundwater indicated anaerobic degradation of a wide range of PAH and heterocyclic compounds. Degradation of naphthalenes in contaminated aquifers could also be confirmed by carbon stable isotope shifts in the residual substrate fraction.},

At mass fractions >0.4, there was a marked concentration dependence of viscosity with a glass-like kinetic arrest observed at mass fractions in the region of 0.55. At mass fractions >0.6 the material behaved as a solid with a Young's modulus rising from approximately 20 MPa at a mass fraction of 0.62-1.1 GPa at 0.86. The solid was viscoelastic and exhibited stress relaxation with relaxation times increasing from 33 to 610 s over the same concentration range. The concentration dependence of the osmotic pressure was measured, at intermediate concentrations, using an osmotic stress technique and could be described using a hard sphere model, indicating that the intermolecular interactions were predominantly repulsive. In summary, a major structural relaxation results from the collective motion of the globules at the supra-globule length scale and, at 20 degrees C, this is arrested at water contents of 40% w/w. This appears to be analogous to the glass transition in colloidal hard spheres.},

abstract = {The G protein alpha subunits, alphas and alphai2, have stimulatory and inhibitory effects, respectively, on a common effector protein, adenylyl cyclase. These effects require a GTP-dependent conformational change that involves three alpha subunit regions (Switches I-III). alphas residues in three adjacent loops, including Switch II, specify activation of adenylyl cyclase. The adenylyl cyclase-specifying region of alphai2 is located within a 78-residue segment that includes two of these loops but none of the conformational switch regions. We have used an alanine-scanning mutagenesis approach within Switches I-III and the 78-residue segment of alphai2 to identify residues required for inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. We found a cluster of conserved residues in Switch II in which substitutions cause major losses in the abilities of both alphai2 and alphas to modulate adenylyl cyclase activity but do not affect alpha subunit expression or the GTP-induced conformational change. We also found two regions within the 78-residue segment of alphai2 in which substitutions reduce the ability of alphai2 to inhibit adenylyl cyclase, one of which corresponds to an effector-activating region of alphas. Thus, both alphai2 and alphas interact with adenylyl cyclase using: 1) conserved Switch II residues that communicate the conformational state of the alpha subunit and 2) divergent residues that specify particular effectors and the nature of their modulation.},

The results do not rely on any assumption that the collective variable dynamics are effectively Brownian or any idealizations of the hill deposition function; instead, they suggest new, more permissive criteria for the method to be well behaved. The results apply to tempered metadynamics with or without adaptive Gaussians or boundary corrections and whether the bias is stored approximately on a grid or exactly.},

We apply the method to the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38$\gamma$. p38$\gamma$ contains allosteric sites that are conserved among eukaryotic kinases as well as unique to the MAPK family. How these regulatory sites communicate with catalytic residues is not well understood. Using our method, we observe and characterize for the first time information flux between regulatory sites through a conserved kinase infrastructure. This network is accessed, reinforced, and broken in various states of p38$\gamma$, reflecting the functional state of the protein. We demonstrate that the approach detects critical junctions in the network corresponding to biologically significant allosteric sites and pathways.},

abstract = {Many human proteins contain intrinsically disordered regions, and disorder in these proteins can be fundamental to their function-for example, facilitating transient but specific binding, promoting allostery, or allowing efficient posttranslational modification. SasG, a multidomain protein implicated in host colonization and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus, provides another example of how disorder can play an important role. Approximately one-half of the domains in the extracellular repetitive region of SasG are intrinsically unfolded in isolation, but these E domains fold in the context of their neighboring folded G5 domains. We have previously shown that the intrinsic disorder of the E domains mediates long-range cooperativity between nonneighboring G5 domains, allowing SasG to form a long, rod-like, mechanically strong structure. Here, we show that the disorder of the E domains coupled with the remarkable stability of the interdomain interface result in cooperative folding kinetics across long distances. Formation of a small structural nucleus at one end of the molecule results in rapid structure formation over a distance of 10 nm, which is likely to be important for the maintenance of the structural integrity of SasG.

abstract = {Extracellular signals prompt G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to adopt an active conformation (R*) and catalyze GDP/GTP exchange in the alpha-subunit of intracellular G proteins (Galphabetagamma). Kinetic analysis of transducin (G(t)alphabetagamma) activation shows that an intermediary R*xG(t)alphabetagamma.GDP complex is formed that precedes GDP release and formation of the nucleotide-free R*xG protein complex. Based on this reaction sequence, we explore the dynamic interface between the proteins during formation of these complexes. We start from the R* conformation stabilized by a G(t)alpha C-terminal peptide (GalphaCT) obtained from crystal structures of the GPCR opsin. Molecular modeling allows reconstruction of the fully elongated C-terminal alpha-helix of G(t)alpha (alpha5) and shows how alpha5 can be docked to the open binding site of R*. Two modes of interaction are found. One of them--termed stable or S-interaction--matches the position of the GalphaCT peptide in the crystal structure and reproduces the hydrogen-bonding networks between the C-terminal reverse turn of GalphaCT and conserved E(D)RY and NPxxY(x)(5,6)F regions of the GPCR. The alternative fit--termed intermediary or I-interaction--is distinguished by a tilt (42 degrees ) and rotation (90 degrees ) of alpha5 relative to the S-interaction and shows different alpha5 contacts with the NPxxY(x)(5,6)F region and the second cytoplasmic loop of R*. From the 2 alpha5 interactions, we derive a "helix switch" mechanism for the transition of R*xG(t)alphabetagamma.GDP to the nucleotide-free R*xG protein complex that illustrates how alpha5 might act as a transmission rod to propagate the conformational change from the receptor-G protein interface to the nucleotide binding site.},

abstract = {Unregulated activation of Src kinases leads to aberrant signalling, uncontrolled growth and differentiation of cancerous cells. Reaching a complete mechanistic understanding of large-scale conformational transformations underlying the activation of kinases could greatly help in the development of therapeutic drugs for the treatment of these pathologies. In principle, the nature of conformational transition could be modelled in silico via atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, although this is very challenging because of the long activation timescales. Here we employ a computational paradigm that couples transition pathway techniques and Markov state model-based massively distributed simulations for mapping the conformational landscape of c-src tyrosine kinase. The computations provide the thermodynamics and kinetics of kinase activation for the first time, and help identify key structural intermediates. Furthermore, the presence of a novel allosteric site in an intermediate state of c-src that could be potentially used for drug design is predicted. },

However, functional changes are not easily explained by differences in crystal structures. We employ Markov state models to identify hidden conformations and explore their role in determining TEM's specificity. We integrate these models with existing drug-design tools to create a new technique, called Boltzmann docking, which better predicts TEM specificity by accounting for conformational heterogeneity. Using our MSMs, we identify hidden states whose populations correlate with activity against cefotaxime. To experimentally detect our predicted hidden states, we use rapid mass spectrometric footprinting and confirm our models' prediction that increased cefotaxime activity correlates with reduced $\Omega$-loop flexibility. Finally, we design novel variants to stabilize the hidden cefotaximase states, and find their populations predict activity against cefotaxime in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we expect this framework to have numerous applications in drug and protein design.},

We apply the method to the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38$\gamma$. p38$\gamma$ contains allosteric sites that are conserved among eukaryotic kinases as well as unique to the MAPK family. How these regulatory sites communicate with catalytic residues is not well understood. Using our method, we observe and characterize for the first time information flux between regulatory sites through a conserved kinase infrastructure. This network is accessed, reinforced, and broken in various states of p38$\gamma$, reflecting the functional state of the protein. We demonstrate that the approach detects critical junctions in the network corresponding to biologically significant allosteric sites and pathways.},

abstract = {Rab GTPases function as essential regulators of vesicle transport in eukaryotic cells. MSS4 was shown to stimulate nucleotide exchange on Rab proteins associated with the exocytic pathway and to have nucleotide-free-Rab chaperone activity. A detailed kinetic analysis of MSS4 interaction with Rab8 showed that MSS4 is a relatively slow exchange factor that forms a long-lived nucleotide-free complex with RabGTPase. In contrast to other characterized exchange factor-GTPase complexes, MSS4:Rab8 complex binds GTP faster than GDP, but still ca. 3 orders of magnitude more slowly than comparable complexes. The crystal structure of the nucleotide-free MSS4:Rab8 complex revealed that MSS4 binds to the Switch I and interswitch regions of Rab8, forming an intermolecular beta-sheet. Complex formation results in dramatic structural changes of the Rab8 molecule, leading to unfolding of the nucleotide-binding site and surrounding structural elements, facilitating nucleotide release and slowing its rebinding. Coupling of nucleotide exchange activity to a cycle of GTPase unfolding and refolding represents a novel nucleotide exchange mechanism.},

abstract = {Allosteric propagation results in communication between distinct sites in the protein structure; it also encodes specific effects on cellular pathways, and in this way it shapes cellular response. One example of long-range effects is binding of morphogens to cell surface receptors, which initiates a cascade of protein interactions that leads to genome activation and specific cellular action. Allosteric propagation results from combinations of multiple factors, takes place through dynamic shifts of conformational ensembles, and affects the equilibria of macromolecular interactions. Here, we (a) emphasize the well-known yet still underappreciated role of allostery in conveying explicit signals across large multimolecular assemblies and distances to specify cellular action; (b) stress the need for quantitation of the allosteric effects; and finally, (c) propose that each specific combination of allosteric effectors along the pathway spells a distinct function. The challenges are colossal; the inspiring reward will be predicting function, misfunction, and outcomes of drug regimes.},

Recent advances in GPCR crystallography have provided inactive and active state structures for rhodopsin and the $\beta$2 adrenergic receptor ($\beta$2AR). Although these structures suggest a two-state 'on-off' mechanism of receptor activation, other biophysical studies and observed signaling versatility suggest that GPCRs are highly dynamic and exist in a multitude of functionally distinct conformations. To fully understand how GPCRs work, we must characterize these conformations and determine how ligands affect their energetics and rates of interconversion.

abstract = {Simulating the conformational dynamics of biomolecules is extremely difficult due to the rugged nature of their free energy landscapes and multiple long-lived, or metastable, states. Generalized ensemble (GE) algorithms, which have become popular in recent years, attempt to facilitate crossing between states at low temperatures by inducing a random walk in temperature space. Enthalpic barriers may be crossed more easily at high temperatures; however, entropic barriers will become more significant. This poses a problem because the dominant barriers to conformational change are entropic for many biological systems, such as the short RNA hairpin studied here. We present a new efficient algorithm for conformational sampling, called the adaptive seeding method (ASM), which uses nonequilibrium GE simulations to identify the metastable states, and seeds short simulations at constant temperature from each of them to quantitatively determine their equilibrium populations. Thus, the ASM takes advantage of the broad sampling possible with GE algorithms but generally crosses entropic barriers more efficiently during the seeding simulations at low temperature. We show that only local equilibrium is necessary for ASM, so very short seeding simulations may be used. Moreover, the ASM may be used to recover equilibrium properties from existing datasets that failed to converge, and is well suited to running on modern computer clusters.},

abstract = {Quantifying the relationship between protein sequence and structure is key to understanding the protein universe. A fundamental measure of this relationship is the total number of amino acid sequences that can fold to a target protein structure, known as the "sequence capacity," which has been suggested as a proxy for how designable a given protein fold is. Although sequence capacity has been extensively studied using lattice models and theory, numerical estimates for real protein structures are currently lacking. In this work, we have quantitatively estimated the sequence capacity of 10 proteins with a variety of different structures using a statistical model based on residue-residue co-evolution to capture the variation of sequences from the same protein family. Remarkably, we find that even for the smallest protein folds, such as the WW domain, the number of foldable sequences is extremely large, exceeding the Avogadro constant. In agreement with earlier theoretical work, the calculated sequence capacity is positively correlated with the size of the protein, or better, the density of contacts. This allows the absolute sequence capacity of a given protein to be approximately predicted from its structure. On the other hand, the relative sequence capacity, i.e., normalized by the total number of possible sequences, is an extremely tiny number and is strongly anti-correlated with the protein length. Thus, although there may be more foldable sequences for larger proteins, it will be much harder to find them. Lastly, we have correlated the evolutionary age of proteins in the CATH database with their sequence capacity as predicted by our model. The results suggest a trade-off between the opposing requirements of high designability and the likelihood of a novel fold emerging by chance.},

abstract = {Heterotrimeric G proteins are key molecular switches that control cell behavior. The canonical activation of G proteins by agonist-occupied G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) has recently been elucidated from the structural perspective. In contrast, the structural basis for GPCR-independent G protein activation by a novel family of guanine-nucleotide exchange modulators (GEMs) remains unknown. Here, we present a 2.0-{\AA} crystal structure of G$\alpha$i in complex with the GEM motif of GIV/Girdin. Nucleotide exchange assays, molecular dynamics simulations, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments demonstrate that GEM binding to the conformational switch II causes structural changes that allosterically propagate to the hydrophobic core of the G$\alpha$i GTPase domain. Rearrangement of the hydrophobic core appears to be a common mechanism by which GPCRs and GEMs activate G proteins, although with different efficiency. Atomic-level insights presented here will aid structure-based efforts to selectively target the noncanonical G protein activation.},

Two areas where users and developers frequently need to extend the built-in capabilities of most software packages are implementing custom interactions, for instance biases derived from experimental data, and running ensembles of simulations. We present a Python high-level interface for the popular simulation package GROMACS that i) allows custom potential functions without modifying the simulation package code, ii) maintains the optimized performance of GROMACS and iii) presents an abstract interface to building and executing computational graphs that allows transparent low-level optimization of data flow and task placement. Minimal dependencies make this integrated API for the GROMACS simulation engine simple, portable and maintainable. We demonstrate this API for experimentally-driven refinement of protein conformational ensembles.

Graph pruning is the process of identifying the most significant edges according to a generative null model and extracting the subgraph consisting of those edges. Here, we focus on integer-weighted graphs commonly arising when weights count the occurrences of an ``event'' relating the nodes. We introduce a simple and intuitive null model related to the configuration model of network generation and derive two significance filters from it: the marginal likelihood filter (MLF) and the global likelihood filter (GLF). The former is a fast algorithm assigning a significance score to each edge based on the marginal distribution of edge weights, whereas the latter is an ensemble approach which takes into account the correlations among edges. We apply these filters to the network of air traffic volume between US airports and recover a geographically faithful representation of the graph. Furthermore, compared with thresholding based on edge weight, we show that our filters extract a larger and significantly sparser giant component.},

abstract = {Heterotrimeric G protein alpha,beta, and gamma subunits are subject to several kinds of co- and post-translational covalent modifications. Among those relevant to G protein-coupled receptor signaling in normal cell function are lipid modifications and phosphorylation. N-myristoylation is a co-translational modification occurring for members of the G(i) family of Galpha subunits, while palmitoylation is a post-translational modification that occurs for these and most other Galpha subunits. One or both modifications are required for plasma membrane targeting and contribute to regulating strength of interaction with the Gbetagamma heterodimer, effectors, and regulators of G protein signaling (RGS proteins). Galpha subunits, including those with transforming activity, are often inactive when unable to be modified with lipids. The reversible nature of palmitoylation is intriguing in this regard, as it lends itself to a regulation integrated with the activation state of the G protein. Several Galpha subunits are substrates for phosphorylation by protein kinase C and at least one is a substrate for phosphorylation by the p21-activated protein kinase. Phosphorylation in both instances inhibits the interactions of these subunits with the Gbetagamma heterodimer and RGS proteins. Several Galpha subunits are also substrates for tyrosine phosphorylation. A Ggamma subunit is phosphorylated by protein kinase C, with the consequence that it interacts more tightly with a Galpha subunit but less well with an effector.},

abstract = {Allostery describes altered protein function at one site due to a perturbation at another site. One mechanism of allostery involves correlated motions, which can occur even in the absence of substantial conformational change. We present a novel method, "MutInf", to identify statistically significant correlated motions from equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach analyzes both backbone and sidechain motions using internal coordinates to account for the gear-like twists that can take place even in the absence of the large conformational changes typical of traditional allosteric proteins. We quantify correlated motions using a mutual information metric, which we extend to incorporate data from multiple short simulations and to filter out correlations that are not statistically significant. Applying our approach to uncover mechanisms of cooperative small molecule binding in human interleukin-2, we identify clusters of correlated residues from 50 ns of molecular dynamics simulations. Interestingly, two of the clusters with the strongest correlations highlight known cooperative small-molecule binding sites and show substantial correlations between these sites. These cooperative binding sites on interleukin-2 are correlated not only through the hydrophobic core of the protein but also through a dynamic polar network of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. Since this approach identifies correlated conformations in an unbiased, statistically robust manner, it should be a useful tool for finding novel or "orphan" allosteric sites in proteins of biological and therapeutic importance.},

abstract = {Despite their great success in practical applications, there is still a lack of theoretical and systematic methods to analyze deep neural networks. In this paper, we illustrate an advanced information theoretic methodology to understand the dynamics of learning and the design of autoencoders, a special type of deep learning architectures that resembles a communication channel. By generalizing the information plane to any cost function, and inspecting the roles and dynamics of different layers using layer-wise information quantities, we emphasize the role that mutual information plays in quantifying learning from data. We further propose and also experimentally validate, for mean square error training, two hypotheses regarding the layer-wise flow of information and intrinsic dimensionality of the bottleneck layer, using respectively the data processing inequality and the identification of a bifurcation point in the information plane that is controlled by the given data. Our observations have direct impact on the optimal design of autoencoders, the design of alternative feedforward training methods, and even in the problem of generalization.},

abstract = {We investigate statistics of dynamical exchange events in coarse-grained models of supercooled liquids in spatial dimensions d=1, 2, and 3. The models, based upon the concept of dynamical facilitation, capture generic features of statistics of exchange times and persistence times. Here, distributions for both times are related and calculated for cases of strong and fragile glass formers over a range of temperatures. Exchange-time distributions are shown to be particularly sensitive to the model parameters and dimensions, and exhibit more structured and richer behavior than persistence-time distributions. Mean exchange times are shown to be Arrhenius, regardless of models and spatial dimensions. Specifically, tx approximately c-2, with c being the excitation concentration. Different dynamical exchange processes are identified and characterized from the underlying trajectories. We discuss experimental possibilities to test some of our theoretical findings.},

abstract = {The outcomes of evolution are determined by a stochastic dynamical process that governs how mutations arise and spread through a population. However, it is difficult to observe these dynamics directly over long periods and across entire genomes. Here we analyse the dynamics of molecular evolution in twelve experimental populations of Escherichia coli, using whole-genome metagenomic sequencing at five hundred-generation intervals through sixty thousand generations. Although the rate of fitness gain declines over time, molecular evolution is characterized by signatures of rapid adaptation throughout the duration of the experiment, with multiple beneficial variants simultaneously competing for dominance in each population. Interactions between ecological and evolutionary processes play an important role, as long-term quasi-stable coexistence arises spontaneously in most populations, and evolution continues within each clade. We also present evidence that the targets of natural selection change over time, as epistasis and historical contingency alter the strength of selection on different genes. Together, these results show that long-term adaptation to a constant environment can be a more complex and dynamic process than is often assumed.},

By fitting the data to the Gordon-Taylor equation, which has previously been used to describe the plasticization of polymers by diluents, the glass-transition temperatures (Tg) for the dry proteins were found by extrapolation. The values for Tg were within the range 397-418 K. Values for the heat capacity increment delta Cp at Tg for the plasticized proteins were also determined and ranged from 0.29-0.47 J g-1 K-1 with no dependence on water content. The differences in glass-transition behaviour of the proteins are discussed in relation to their secondary structure.},

Furthermore, several reference codes have been integrated into Jupyter notebooks, allowing background, underlying theory, and formula information to be associated with the implementation.

In particular, picking initial CVs is particularly challenging in higher dimensions. Which atomic coordinates or transforms there of from a list of thousands should one pick for enhanced sampling runs? How does a modeler even begin to pick starting coordinates for investigation? This remains true even in the case of simple two state systems and only increases in difficulty for multi-state systems. In this work, we solve the "initial" CV problem using a data-driven approach inspired by the field of supervised machine learning (SML). In particular, we show how the decision functions in SML algorithms can be used as initial CVs (SMLcv ) for accelerated sampling. Using solvated alanine dipeptide and Chignolin mini-protein as our test cases, we illustrate how the distance to the support vector machines' decision hyperplane, the output probability estimates from logistic regression, the outputs from shallow or deep neural network classifiers, and other classifiers may be used to reversibly sample slow structural transitions. We discuss the utility of other SML algorithms that might be useful for identifying CVs for accelerating molecular simulations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Gq is a heterotrimeric G protein that plays an important role in numerous physiological processes. To delineate the molecular mechanisms and kinetics of signalling through this protein, its activation should be measurable in single living cells. Recently, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensors have been developed for this purpose.

RESULTS:In this paper, we describe the development of an improved FRET-based Gq activity sensor that consists of a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged G$\gamma$2 subunit and a G$\alpha$q subunit with an inserted monomeric Turquoise (mTurquoise), the best cyan fluorescent protein variant currently available. This sensor enabled us to determine, for the first time, the kon (2/s) of Gq activation. In addition, we found that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor p63RhoGEF has a profound effect on the number of Gq proteins that become active upon stimulation of endogenous histamine H1 receptors. The sensor was also used to measure ligand-independent activation of the histamine H1 receptor (H1R) upon addition of a hypotonic stimulus.

CONCLUSIONS:Our observations reveal that the application of a truncated mTurquoise as donor and a YFP-tagged G$\gamma$2 as acceptor in FRET-based Gq activity sensors substantially improves their dynamic range. This optimization enables the real-time single cell quantification of Gq signalling dynamics, the influence of accessory proteins and allows future drug screening applications by virtue of its sensitivity.},

abstract = {The crystal structure of P2Y1 receptor (P2Y1R), a class A GPCR, revealed a special extra-helical site for its antagonist, BPTU, which locates in-between the membrane and the protein. However, due to the limitation of crystallization experiments, the membrane was mimicked by use of detergents, and the information related to the binding of BPTU to the receptor in the membrane environment is rather limited. In the present work, we conducted a total of ∼7.5 $\mu$s all-atom simulations in explicit solvent using conventional molecular dynamics and multiple enhanced sampling methods, with models of BPTU and a POPC bilayer, both in the absence and presence of P2Y1R. Our simulations revealed that BPTU prefers partitioning into the interface of polar/lipophilic region of the lipid bilayer before associating with the receptor. Then, it interacts with the second extracellular loop of the receptor and reaches the binding site through the lipid-receptor interface. In addition, by use of funnel-metadynamics simulations which efficiently enhance the sampling of bound and unbound states, we provide a statistically accurate description of the underlying binding free energy landscape. The calculated absolute ligand-receptor binding affinity is in excellent agreement with the experimental data ($\Delta$ Gb0_theo = -11.5 kcal mol-1, $\Delta$ Gb0_exp= -11.7 kcal mol-1). Our study broadens the view of the current experimental/theoretical models and our understanding of the protein-ligand recognition mechanism in the lipid environment. The strategy used in this work is potentially applicable to investigate ligands association/dissociation with other membrane-embedded sites, allowing identification of compounds targeting membrane receptors of pharmacological interest.},

A purely mechanical view of allostery invoking only structural changes has developed over the decades as the classical view of the phenomenon. However, a fast growing list of examples illustrate the intimate link between internal motions over a wide range of time scales and function in protein-ligand interactions. Proteins respond to perturbations by redistributing their motions and they use fluctuating conformational states for binding and conformational entropy as a carrier of allosteric energy to modulate association with ligands. In several cases allosteric interactions proceed with minimal or no structural changes. We discuss emerging paradigms for the central role of protein dynamics in allostery.},

We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.},

The method is illustrated by its application to the Ets-1 transcription factor, which partially unfolds upon binding DNA. The calculations show dramatic changes in the direction of information flow upon DNA binding, and elucidate how the presence of DNA is communicated from the DNA binding H1 and H3 helices to inhibitory helix HI-1.

abstract = {Signals from 800 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to many SH3 domain-containing proteins (SH3-CPs) regulate important physiological functions. These GPCRs may share a common pathway by signaling to SH3-CPs via agonist-dependent arrestin recruitment rather than through direct interactions. In the present study, 19F-NMR and cellular studies revealed that downstream of GPCR activation engagement of the receptor-phospho-tail with arrestin allosterically regulates the specific conformational states and functional outcomes of remote $\beta$-arrestin 1 proline regions (PRs). The observed NMR chemical shifts of arrestin PRs were consistent with the intrinsic efficacy and specificity of SH3 domain recruitment, which was controlled by defined propagation pathways. Moreover, in vitro reconstitution experiments and biophysical results showed that the receptor-arrestin complex promoted SRC kinase activity through an allosteric mechanism. Thus, allosteric regulation of the conformational states of $\beta$-arrestin 1 PRs by GPCRs and the allosteric activation of downstream effectors by arrestin are two important mechanisms underlying GPCR-to-SH3-CP signaling.},

abstract = {The Ras gene is frequently mutated in cancer, and mutant Ras drives tumorigenesis. Although Ras is a central oncogene, small molecules that bind to Ras in a well-defined manner and exert inhibitory effects have not been uncovered to date. Through an NMR-based fragment screen, we identified a group of small molecules that all bind to a common site on Ras. High-resolution cocrystal structures delineated a unique ligand-binding pocket on the Ras protein that is adjacent to the switch I/II regions and can be expanded upon compound binding. Structure analysis predicts that compound-binding interferes with the Ras/SOS interactions. Indeed, selected compounds inhibit SOS-mediated nucleotide exchange and prevent Ras activation by blocking the formation of intermediates of the exchange reaction. The discovery of a small-molecule binding pocket on Ras with functional significance provides a new direction in the search of therapeutically effective inhibitors of the Ras oncoprotein.},

The sites of mutations which are responsible for the cAMP independent phenotype were determined by in vitro recombination and DNA sequencing. The amino acid substitutions in the mutant proteins were found in two specific regions of the crp gene encoding residues 53-62 and 141-148 of CRP polypeptide.

The molecular mechanisms by which TLR9 becomes activated or is inhibited are not well understood. Here we show that TLR9 bound to stimulatory and inhibitory DNA; however, only stimulatory DNA led to substantial conformational changes in the TLR9 ectodomain. In the steady state, 'inactive' TLR9 homodimers formed in an inactivated conformation. Binding of DNA containing CpG, but not of DNA lacking CpG, to TLR9 dimers resulted in allosteric changes in the TLR9 cytoplasmic signaling domains. In endosomes, conformational changes induced by DNA containing CpG resulted in close apposition of the cytoplasmic signaling domains, a change that is probably required for the recruitment of signaling adaptor molecules. Our results indicate that the formation of TLR9 dimers is not sufficient for its activation but instead that TLR9 activation is regulated by conformational changes induced by DNA containing CpG.},

abstract = {Molecular recognition is central to all biological processes. For the past 50 years, Koshland's 'induced fit' hypothesis has been the textbook explanation for molecular recognition events. However, recent experimental evidence supports an alternative mechanism. 'Conformational selection' postulates that all protein conformations pre-exist, and the ligand selects the most favored conformation. Following binding the ensemble undergoes a population shift, redistributing the conformational states. Both conformational selection and induced fit appear to play roles. Following binding by a primary conformational selection event, optimization of side chain and backbone interactions is likely to proceed by an induced fit mechanism. Conformational selection has been observed for protein-ligand, protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA and RNA-ligand interactions. These data support a new molecular recognition paradigm for processes as diverse as signaling, catalysis, gene regulation and protein aggregation in disease, which has the potential to significantly impact our views and strategies in drug design, biomolecular engineering and molecular evolution.},

abstract = {The mechanism of ligand binding coupled to conformational changes in macromolecules has recently attracted considerable interest. The 2 limiting cases are the "induced fit" mechanism (binding first) or "conformational selection" (conformational change first). Described here are the criteria by which the sequence of events can be determined quantitatively. The relative importance of the 2 pathways is determined not by comparing rate constants (a common misconception) but instead by comparing the flux through each pathway. The simple rules for calculating flux in multistep mechanisms are described and then applied to 2 examples from the literature, neither of which has previously been analyzed using the concept of flux. The first example is the mechanism of conformational change in the binding of NADPH to dihydrofolate reductase. The second example is the mechanism of flavodoxin folding coupled to binding of its cofactor, flavin mononucleotide. In both cases, the mechanism switches from being dominated by the conformational selection pathway at low ligand concentration to induced fit at high ligand concentration. Over a wide range of conditions, a significant fraction of the flux occurs through both pathways. Such a mixed mechanism likely will be discovered for many cases of coupled conformational change and ligand binding when kinetic data are analyzed by using a flux-based approach.},

abstract = {Long-lived conformational states and their interconversion rates critically determine protein function and regulation. When these states have distinct chemical shifts, the measurement of relaxation by NMR may provide us with useful information about their structure, kinetics, and thermodynamics at atomic resolution. However, as these experimental data are sensitive to many structural and dynamic effects, their interpretation with phenomenological models is challenging, even if only a few metastable states are involved. Consequently, approximations and simplifications must often be used which increase the risk of missing important microscopic features hidden in the data. Here, we show how molecular dynamics simulations analyzed through Markov state models and the related hidden Markov state models may be used to establish mechanistic models that provide a microscopic interpretation of NMR relaxation data. Using ubiquitin and BPTI as examples, we demonstrate how the approach allows us to dissect experimental data into a number of dynamic processes between metastable states. Such a microscopic view may greatly facilitate the mechanistic interpretation of experimental data and serve as a next-generation method for the validation of molecular mechanics force fields and chemical shift prediction algorithms.},

Gsalpha is the prototypic member of a family of GTP-binding proteins that regulate the activities of effectors in a hormone-dependent manner. Comparison of the structure of Gsalpha.GTPgammaS with that of Gialpha.GTPgammaS suggests that their effector specificity is primarily dictated by the shape of the binding surface formed by the switch II helix and the alpha3-beta5 loop, despite the high sequence homology of these elements. In contrast, sequence divergence explains the inability of regulators of G protein signaling to stimulate the GTPase activity of Gsalpha. The betagamma binding surface of Gsalpha is largely conserved in sequence and structure to that of Gialpha, whereas differences in the surface formed by the carboxyl-terminal helix and the alpha4-beta6 loop may mediate receptor specificity.},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptor-mediated heterotrimeric G protein activation is a major mode of signal transduction in the cell. Previously, we and other groups reported that the $\alpha$5 helix of G$\alpha$i1, especially the hydrophobic interactions in this region, plays a key role during nucleotide release and G protein activation. To further investigate the effect of this hydrophobic core, we disrupted it in G$\alpha$i1 by inserting 4 alanine amino acids into the $\alpha$5 helix between residues Gln(333) and Phe(334) (Ins4A). This extends the length of the $\alpha$5 helix without disturbing the $\beta$6-$\alpha$5 loop interactions. This mutant has high basal nucleotide exchange activity yet no receptor-mediated activation of nucleotide exchange. By using structural approaches, we show that this mutant loses critical hydrophobic interactions, leading to significant rearrangements of side chain residues His(57), Phe(189), Phe(191), and Phe(336); it also disturbs the rotation of the $\alpha$5 helix and the $\pi$-$\pi$ interaction between His(57) and Phe(189) In addition, the insertion mutant abolishes G protein release from the activated receptor after nucleotide binding. Our biochemical and computational data indicate that the interactions between $\alpha$5, $\alpha$1, and $\beta$2-$\beta$3 are not only vital for GDP release during G protein activation, but they are also necessary for proper GTP binding (or GDP rebinding). Thus, our studies suggest that this hydrophobic interface is critical for accurate rearrangement of the $\alpha$5 helix for G protein release from the receptor after GTP binding.},

We describe an improved protocol for constructing Markov State Models from molecular dynamics simulations. The new protocol includes advances in clustering, data preparation, and model estimation; these improvements lead to significant increases in model accuracy, as assessed by the ability to recapitulate equilibrium and kinetic properties of reference systems.

abstract = {Markov state models (MSMs) have become the tool of choice to analyze large amounts of molecular dynamics data by approximating them as a Markov jump process between suitably predefined states. Here we investigate "Core Set MSMs," a new type of MSMs that build on metastable core sets acting as milestones for tracing the rare event kinetics. We present a thorough analysis of Core Set MSMs based on the existing milestoning framework, Bayesian estimation methods and Transition Path Theory (TPT). We show that Core Set MSMs can be used to extract phenomenological rate constants between the metastable sets of the system and to approximate the evolution of certain key observables. The performance of Core Set MSMs in comparison to standard MSMs is analyzed and illustrated on a toy example and in the context of the torsion angle dynamics of alanine dipeptide.},

abstract = {G protein activation by G protein-coupled receptors is one of the critical steps for many cellular signal transduction pathways. Previously, we and other groups reported that the $\alpha$5 helix in the G protein $\alpha$ subunit plays a major role during this activation process. However, the precise signaling pathway between the $\alpha$5 helix and the guanosine diphosphate (GDP) binding pocket remains elusive. Here, using structural, biochemical, and computational techniques, we probed different residues around the $\alpha$5 helix for their role in signaling. Our data showed that perturbing the Phe-336 residue disturbs hydrophobic interactions with the $\beta$2-$\beta$3 strands and $\alpha$1 helix, leading to high basal nucleotide exchange. However, mutations in $\beta$ strands $\beta$5 and $\beta$6 do not perturb G protein activation. We have highlighted critical residues that leverage Phe-336 as a relay. Conformational changes are transmitted starting from Phe-336 via $\beta$2-$\beta$3/$\alpha$1 to Switch I and the phosphate binding loop, decreasing the stability of the GDP binding pocket and triggering nucleotide release. When the $\alpha$1 and $\alpha$5 helices were cross-linked, inhibiting the receptor-mediated displacement of the C-terminal $\alpha$5 helix, mutation of Phe-336 still leads to high basal exchange rates. This suggests that unlike receptor-mediated activation, helix 5 rotation and translocation are not necessary for GDP release from the $\alpha$ subunit. Rather, destabilization of the backdoor region of the G$\alpha$ subunit is sufficient for triggering the activation process.},

abstract = {Allosteric communication is a fundamental process that proteins use to propagate signals from one site to functionally important distal sites. Although allostery is usually associated with multimeric proteins and enzymes, "long-range" communication may be a fundamental property of proteins. In some cases, communication occurs with minimal structural change. PDZ (post-synaptic density-95/discs large/zonula occludens-1) domains are small, protein-protein binding modules that can use multiple surfaces for docking diverse molecules. Furthermore, these domains have long-range energetic couplings that link the ligand-binding site to distal regions of the structure. Here, we show that allosteric behavior in a representative member of the PDZ domain family may be directly detected using side-chain methyl dynamics measurements. The changes in side-chain dynamics parameters in the second PDZ domain from the human tyrosine phosphatase 1E (hPTP1E) were determined upon binding a peptide target. Long-range dynamic effects were detected that correspond to previously observed pair-wise energetic couplings. These results provide one of the first experimental examples for the potential role of ps-ns timescale dynamics in propagating long-range signals within a protein, and reinforce the idea that dynamic fluctuations in proteins contribute to allosteric signal transduction.},

The high-resolution structure of holo-PS1 is in sub-{\AA} agreement with the design. The structure of apo-PS1 retains the remote core packing of the holoprotein, with a flexible binding region that is predisposed to ligand binding with the desired geometry.

Here, 19F NMR is used to delineate the effects of cations on functional states of the adenosine A2A GPCR. While Na+ reinforces an inactive ensemble and a partial-agonist stabilized state, Ca2+ and Mg2+ shift the equilibrium toward active states. Positive allosteric effects of divalent cations are more pronounced with agonist and a G-protein-derived peptide. In cell membranes, divalent cations enhance both the affinity and fraction of the high affinity agonist-bound state. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest high concentrations of divalent cations bridge specific extracellular acidic residues, bringing TM5 and TM6 together at the extracellular surface and allosterically driving open the G-protein-binding cleft as shown by rigidity-transmission allostery theory. An understanding of cation allostery should enable the design of allosteric agents and enhance our understanding of GPCR regulation in the cellular milieu.},

abstract = {Much work has been done in the past decade to quantify the phenomenon of allosteric communication in proteins. Every new study unveils an extra piece of the puzzle in our search for an understanding of allostery that allows us to make predictions on the response of a protein to medically relevant stimuli such as pathological mutations or drug binding. This review summarizes recent advances in the analysis of mechanisms of allosteric communication in proteins, and combines this new knowledge to offer a perspective of allostery which is consistent with chemical views of molecular processes. First, we review recent work, particularly computational, on the characterization of signal propagation and conformational changes in allosteric proteins. We then compare different models of allostery, and discuss the significance of the concept of an allosteric pathway. We argue that allostery can be rationalized in terms of pathways of residues that efficiently transmit energy between different binding sites. We then provide examples that show how this picture could account for most of the observed data, since energy flow may be manifested as changes in both structure and dynamics. We conclude by acknowledging that the proposed view is still a simplification and should not be taken as a rigorous model of allosteric communication in proteins. Nevertheless, simple pictures like this can go a long way in improving our understanding of many complex phenomena observed in nature.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:Glucocorticoids (GC) are used to improve respiratory mechanics in preterm infants despite clinical evidence linking neonatal GC therapy to cerebellar pathology. In developing mouse cerebellum, the GC dexamethasone (DEX) causes rapid GC-induced neural progenitor cell apoptosis (GINA). Focusing on pharmacological neuroprotection strategies, we investigated whether dexmedetomidine (DMT) protects against GINA.

METHODS:Neonatal mice were pretreated with DMT prior to DEX challenge. Additionally, we tested clonidine and yohimbine in vivo to determine mechanism of DMT neuroprotection. For in vitro studies, cerebellar neural progenitor cells were pretreated with DMT before DEX challenge.

RESULTS:In vivo, DMT attenuated GINA at 1 {\textmu}g/kg and above, p < 0.0001. Clonidine significantly attenuated GINA, p < 0.0001, while yohimbine reversed DMT neuroprotection, p < 0.0001, suggesting DMT neuroprotection is likely mediated via adrenergic signaling. In vitro, DMT neuroprotection was achieved at 10 {\textmu}M and above, p < 0.001, indicating DMT rescue is cell autonomous.

CONCLUSIONS:DMT affords dose-dependent neuroprotection from GINA at clinically relevant doses, an effect that is cell autonomous and likely mediated by $\alpha$2 adrenergic receptor agonism. DMT co-administration with GCs may be an effective strategy to protect the neonatal brain from GINA while retaining the beneficial effects of GCs on respiratory mechanics.},

abstract = {Many systems in nature, society, and technology can be described as networks, where the vertices are the system{\textquoteright}s elements, and edges between vertices indicate the interactions between the corresponding elements. Edges may be weighted if the interaction strength is measurable. However, the full network information is often redundant because tools and techniques from network analysis do not work or become very inefficient if the network is too dense, and some weights may just reflect measurement errors and need to be be discarded. Moreover, since weight distributions in many complex weighted networks are broad, most of the weight is concentrated among a small fraction of all edges. It is then crucial to properly detect relevant edges. Simple thresholding would leave only the largest weights, disrupting the multiscale structure of the system, which is at the basis of the structure of complex networks and ought to be kept. In this paper we propose a weight-filtering technique based on a global null model [Global Statistical Significance (GloSS) filter], keeping both the weight distribution and the full topological structure of the network. The method correctly quantifies the statistical significance of weights assigned independently to the edges from a given distribution. Applications to real networks reveal that the GloSS filter is indeed able to identify relevant connections between vertices.},

abstract = {Interest in atomically detailed simulations has grown significantly with recent advances in computational hardware and Markov state modeling (MSM) methods, yet outstanding questions remain that hinder their widespread adoption. Namely, how do alternative sampling strategies explore conformational space and how might this influence predictions generated from the data? Here, we seek to answer these questions for four commonly used sampling methods: (1) a single long simulation, (2) many short simulations run in parallel, (3) adaptive sampling, and (4) our recently developed goal-oriented sampling algorithm, FAST. We first develop a theoretical framework for analytically calculating the probability of discovering select states on simple landscapes, where we uncover the drastic effects of varying the number and length of simulations. We then use kinetic Monte Carlo simulations on a variety of physically inspired landscapes to characterize the probability of discovering particular states and transition pathways for each of the four methods. Consistently, we find that FAST simulations discover each target state with the highest probability, while traversing realistic pathways. Furthermore, we uncover the potential pathology that short parallel simulations sometimes predict an incorrect transition pathway by crossing large energy barriers that long simulations would typically circumnavigate. We refer to this pathology as "pathway tunneling". To protect against this phenomenon when using adaptive-sampling and FAST simulations, we introduce the FAST-string method. This method enhances sampling along the highest-flux transition paths to refine an MSMs transition probabilities and discriminate between competing pathways. Additionally, we compare the performance of a variety of MSM estimators in describing accurate thermodynamics and kinetics. For adaptive sampling, we recommend simply normalizing the transition counts out of each state after adding small pseudocounts to avoid creating sources or sinks. Lastly, we evaluate whether our insights from simple landscapes hold for all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the folding of the $\lambda$-repressor protein. Remarkably, we find that FAST-contacts predicts the same folding pathway as a set of long simulations but with orders of magnitude less simulation time.},

abstract = {<p>In humans, the 813 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are responsible for transducing diverse chemical stimuli to alter cell state, and are the largest class of drug targets. Their myriad structural conformations and various modes of signaling make it challenging to understand their structure and function. Here we developed a platform to characterize large libraries of GPCR variants in human cell lines with a barcoded transcriptional reporter of G-protein signal transduction. We tested 7,800 of 7,828 possible single amino acid substitutions to the beta-2 adrenergic receptor ($\beta$2AR) at four concentrations of the agonist isoproterenol. We identified residues specifically important for $\beta$2AR signaling, mutations in the human population that are potentially loss of function, and residues that modulate basal activity. Using unsupervised learning, we resolve residues critical for signaling, including all major structural motifs and molecular interfaces. We also find a previously uncharacterized structural latch spanning the first two extracellular loops that is highly conserved across Class A GPCRs and is conformationally rigid in both the inactive and active states of the receptor. More broadly, by linking deep mutational scanning with engineered transcriptional reporters, we establish a generalizable method for exploring pharmacogenomics, structure and function across broad classes of drug receptors.</p>},

abstract = {Detailed understanding of how conformational dynamics orchestrates function in allosteric regulation of recognition and catalysis remains ambiguous. Here, we simulate CypA using multiple-microsecond-long atomistic molecular dynamics in explicit solvent and carry out NMR experiments. We analyze a large amount of time-dependent multidimensional data with a coarse-grained approach and map key dynamical features within individual macrostates by defining dynamics in terms of residue-residue contacts. The effects of substrate binding are observed to be largely sensed at a location over 15 {\AA} from the active site, implying its importance in allostery. Using NMR experiments, we confirm that a dynamic cluster of residues in this distal region is directly coupled to the active site. Furthermore, the dynamical network of interresidue contacts is found to be coupled and temporally dispersed, ranging over 4 to 5 orders of magnitude. Finally, using network centrality measures we demonstrate the changes in the communication network, connectivity, and influence of CypA residues upon substrate binding, mutation, and during catalysis. We identify key residues that potentially act as a bottleneck in the communication flow through the distinct regions in CypA and, therefore, as targets for future mutational studies. Mapping these dynamical features and the coupling of dynamics to function has crucial ramifications in understanding allosteric regulation in enzymes and proteins, in general.},

In principle, evolution to this high-resistance beta-lactamase might follow any of the 120 mutational trajectories linking these alleles. However, we demonstrate that 102 trajectories are inaccessible to Darwinian selection and that many of the remaining trajectories have negligible probabilities of realization, because four of these five mutations fail to increase drug resistance in some combinations. Pervasive biophysical pleiotropy within the beta-lactamase seems to be responsible, and because such pleiotropy appears to be a general property of missense mutations, we conclude that much protein evolution will be similarly constrained. This implies that the protein tape of life may be largely reproducible and even predictable.},

abstract = {Allosteric drug development holds promise for delivering medicines that are more selective and less toxic than those that target orthosteric sites. To date, the discovery of allosteric binding sites and lead compounds has been mostly serendipitous, achieved through high-throughput screening. Over the past decade, structural data has become more readily available for larger protein systems and more membrane protein classes (e.g., GPCRs and ion channels), which are common allosteric drug targets. In parallel, improved simulation methods now provide better atomistic understanding of the protein dynamics and cooperative motions that are critical to allosteric mechanisms. As a result of these advances, the field of predictive allosteric drug development is now on the cusp of a new era of rational structure-based computational methods. Here, we review algorithms that predict allosteric sites based on sequence data and molecular dynamics simulations, describe tools that assess the druggability of these pockets, and discuss how Markov state models and topology analyses provide insight into the relationship between protein dynamics and allosteric drug binding. In each section, we first provide an overview of the various method classes before describing relevant algorithms and software packages.},

abstract = {The carboxyl terminus of the G protein alpha subunit plays a key role in interactions with G protein-coupled receptors. Previous studies that have incorporated covalently attached probes have demonstrated that the carboxyl terminus undergoes conformational changes upon G protein activation. To examine the conformational changes that occur at the carboxyl terminus of Galpha subunits upon G protein activation in a more native system, we generated a semisynthetic Galpha subunit, site-specifically labeled in its carboxyl terminus with 13C amino acids. Using expressed protein ligation, 9-mer peptides were ligated to recombinant Galpha(i1) subunits lacking the corresponding carboxyl-terminal residues. In a receptor-G protein reconstitution assay, the truncated Galpha(i1) subunit could not be activated by receptor; whereas the semisynthetic protein demonstrated functionality that was comparable with recombinant Galpha(i1). To study the conformation of the carboxyl terminus of the semisynthetic G protein, we applied high resolution solution NMR to Galpha subunits containing 13C labels at the corresponding sites in Galpha(i1): Leu-348 (uniform), Gly-352 (alpha carbon), and Phe-354 (ring). In the GDP-bound state, the spectra of the ligated carboxyl terminus appeared similar to the spectra obtained for 13C-labeled free peptide. Upon titration with increasing concentrations of AlF4-, the 13C resonances demonstrated a marked loss of signal intensity in the semisynthetic Galpha subunit but not in free peptide subjected to the same conditions. Because AlF4- complexes with GDP to stabilize an activated state of the Galpha subunit, these results suggest that the Galpha carboxyl terminus is highly mobile in its GDP-bound state but adopts an ordered conformation upon activation by AlF4-.},

However, there is virtually no direct experimental evidence to support the notion that individual dynamic modes are required for specific catalytic processes, apart from the initial step of substrate binding. In this work, we use a unique approach based on millisecond hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to identify dynamic modes linked to individual catalytic processes in the antibiotic resistance enzyme TEM-1 $\beta$-lactamase. Using a 'good' substrate (ampicillin), a poorly hydrolyzed substrate (cephalexin) and a covalent inhibitor (clavulanate), we are able to isolate dynamic modes that are specifically linked to substrate binding, productive lactam ring hydrolysis and deacylation.

abstract = {We introduce a coarse-grained model for atomic glass formers. Its elements are physically motivated local microscopic dynamical rules parameterized by observables. Results of the model are established and used to interpret the measured behaviors of supercooled fluids approaching glass transitions. The model predicts the presence of a crossover from hierarchical super-Arrhenius dynamics at short length scales to diffusive Arrhenius dynamics at large length scales. This prediction distinguishes our model from other theories of glass formers and can be tested by experiment.},

abstract = {Frizzled receptors (FZDs) are class-F G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that function in Wnt signalling and are essential for developing and adult organisms1,2. As central mediators in this complex signalling pathway, FZDs serve as gatekeeping proteins both for drug intervention and for the development of probes in basic and~in therapeutic research. Here we present an atomic-resolution structure of the human Frizzled 4 receptor (FZD4) transmembrane domain in the absence of a bound ligand. The structure reveals an unusual transmembrane architecture in which helix VI is short and tightly packed, and is distinct from all other GPCR structures reported so far. Within this unique transmembrane fold is an extremely narrow and highly hydrophilic pocket that is not amenable to the binding of traditional GPCR ligands. We show that such a pocket is conserved across all FZDs, which may explain the long-standing difficulties in the development of ligands for these receptors. Molecular dynamics simulations on the microsecond timescale and mutational analysis uncovered two coupled, dynamic kinks located at helix VII that are involved in FZD4 activation. The stability of the structure in its ligand-free form, an unfavourable pocket for ligand binding and the two unusual kinks on helix VII suggest that FZDs may have evolved a novel ligand-recognition and activation mechanism that is distinct from that of other GPCRs.},

abstract = {K-Ras is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancers, but there are still no drugs that directly target it in the clinic. Recent studies utilizing dynamics information show promising results for selectively targeting mutant K-Ras. However, despite extensive characterization, the mechanisms by which K-Ras residue fluctuations transfer allosteric regulatory information remain unknown. Understanding the direction of information flow can provide new mechanistic insights for K-Ras targeting. Here, we present a novel approach -conditional time-delayed correlations (CTC) - using the motions of all residue pairs of a protein to predict directionality in the allosteric regulation of the protein fluctuations. Analyzing nucleotide-dependent intrinsic K-Ras motions with the new approach yields predictions that agree with the literature, showing that GTP-binding stabilizes K-Ras motions and leads to residue correlations with relatively long characteristic decay times. Furthermore, our study is the first to identify driver-follower relationships in correlated motions of K-Ras residue pairs, revealing the direction of information flow during allosteric modulation of its nucleotide-dependent intrinsic activity: active K-Ras Switch-II region motions drive Switch-I region motions, while $\alpha$-helix-3L7 motions control both. Our results provide novel insights for strategies that directly target mutant K-Ras.},

abstract = {Common algorithms for computationally simulating Langevin dynamics must discretize the stochastic differential equations of motion. These resulting finite time step integrators necessarily have several practical issues in common: Microscopic reversibility is violated, the sampled stationary distribution differs from the desired equilibrium distribution, and the work accumulated in nonequilibrium simulations is not directly usable in estimators based on nonequilibrium work theorems. Here, we show that even with a time-independent Hamiltonian, finite time step Langevin integrators can be thought of as a driven, nonequilibrium physical process. Once an appropriate work-like quantity is defined -- here called the shadow work -- recently developed nonequilibrium fluctuation theorems can be used to measure or correct for the errors introduced by the use of finite time steps. In particular, we demonstrate that amending estimators based on nonequilibrium work theorems to include this shadow work removes the time step dependent error from estimates of free energies. We also quantify, for the first time, the magnitude of deviations between the sampled stationary distribution and the desired equilibrium distribution for equilibrium Langevin simulations of solvated systems of varying size. While these deviations can be large, they can be eliminated altogether by Metropolization or greatly diminished by small reductions in the time step. Through this connection with driven processes, further developments in nonequilibrium fluctuation theorems can provide additional analytical tools for dealing with errors in finite time step integrators.

Here, we describe the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the bovine membrane AC9 bound to an activated G protein $\alpha$s subunit at 3.4-angstrom resolution. The structure reveals the organization of the membrane domain and helical domain that spans between the membrane and catalytic domains of AC9. The carboxyl-terminal extension of the catalytic domain occludes both the catalytic and the allosteric sites of AC9, inducing a conformation distinct from the substrate- and activator-bound state, suggesting a regulatory role in cAMP production.},

In this work we demonstrate how a recently introduced metadynamics-based approach allows exploration of the unbinding pathways, estimation of the rates, and determination of the rate-limiting steps in the paradigmatic case of the trypsin-benzamidine system. Protein, ligand, and solvent are described with full atomic resolution. Using metadynamics, multiple unbinding trajectories that start with the ligand in the crystallographic binding pose and end with the ligand in the fully solvated state are generated. The unbinding rate k off is computed from the mean residence time of the ligand. Using our previously computed binding affinity we also obtain the binding rate k on. Both rates are in agreement with reported experimental values. We uncover the complex pathways of unbinding trajectories and describe the critical rate-limiting steps with unprecedented detail. Our findings illuminate the role played by the coupling between subtle protein backbone fluctuations and the solvation by water molecules that enter the binding pocket and assist in the breaking of the shielded hydrogen bonds. We expect our approach to be useful in calculating rates for general protein-ligand systems and a valid support for drug design.},

Monte Carlo simulations of an atomistic model exhibit thermal fluctuations among a diverse set of side-chain arrangements, even with the peptide backbone fixed in its crystallographic conformation. We have quantified the torsional entropy of this native-state ensemble, relative to that of a noninteracting reference system, for 12 small proteins. The reduction in entropy per rotatable bond due to each kind of interaction is remarkably consistent across this set of molecules. To assess the biophysical importance of these fluctuations, we have estimated side-chain entropy contributions to the binding affinity of several peptide ligands with calmodulin. Calculations for our fixed-backbone model correlate very well with experimentally determined binding entropies over a range spanning more than 80 kJ/(mol x 308 K).},

abstract = {The Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF) binds to the tail of the beta2-adrenergic receptor and plays a role in adrenergic regulation of Na+/H+ exchange. NHERF contains two PDZ domains, the first of which is required for its interaction with the beta2 receptor. Mutagenesis studies of the beta2 receptor tail revealed that the optimal C-terminal motif for binding to the first PDZ domain of NHERF is D-S/T-x-L, a motif distinct from those recognized by other PDZ domains. The first PDZ domain of NHERF-2, a protein that is 52% identical to NHERF and also known as E3KARP, SIP-1, and TKA-1, exhibits binding preferences very similar to those of the first PDZ domain of NHERF. The delineation of the preferred binding motif for the first PDZ domain of the NHERF family of proteins allows for predictions for other proteins that may interact with NHERF or NHERF-2. For example, as would be predicted from the beta2 receptor tail mutagenesis studies, NHERF binds to the tail of the purinergic P2Y1 receptor, a seven-transmembrane receptor with an intracellular C-terminal tail ending in D-T-S-L. NHERF also binds to the tail of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, which ends in D-T-R-L. Because the preferred binding motif of the first PDZ domain of the NHERF family of proteins is found at the C termini of a variety of intracellular proteins, NHERF and NHERF-2 may be multifunctional adaptor proteins involved in many previously unsuspected aspects of intracellular signaling.},

abstract = {The mechanisms by which enzymes achieve extraordinary rate acceleration and specificity have long been of key interest in biochemistry. It is generally recognized that substrate binding coupled to conformational changes of the substrate-enzyme complex aligns the reactive groups in an optimal environment for efficient chemistry. Although chemical mechanisms have been elucidated for many enzymes, the question of how enzymes achieve the catalytically competent state has only recently become approachable by experiment and computation. Here we show crystallographic evidence for conformational substates along the trajectory towards the catalytically competent 'closed' state in the ligand-free form of the enzyme adenylate kinase. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that these partially closed conformations are sampled in nanoseconds, whereas nuclear magnetic resonance and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer reveal rare sampling of a fully closed conformation occurring on the microsecond-to-millisecond timescale. Thus, the larger-scale motions in substrate-free adenylate kinase are not random, but preferentially follow the pathways that create the configuration capable of proficient chemistry. Such preferred directionality, encoded in the fold, may contribute to catalysis in many enzymes.},

ApoE4 contains an arginine residue at position 112, whereas apoE3 has a cysteine at this position. ApoE4 is the major risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, whereas apoE3, the common isoform, is neutral with respect to this disease. Here, using literature data from both hydrogen-deuterium exchange and site-directed mutations, we suggest structural differences between these two isoforms that are distant from the site of the arginine-to-cysteine change. These structural differences involve sequences from both the N- and C-terminal domains, sequentially far apart but structurally close. In addition, these regions are close to regions that bind lipid and to a region involved in association of apoE monomers to higher molecular weight forms. We discuss the possibility that these regions could be targeted preferentially to affect the function of apoE4 relative to apoE3.},

abstract = {The review describes four flavin-containing cytoplasmatic multienzyme complexes from anaerobic bacteria and archaea that catalyze the reduction of the low potential ferredoxin by electron donors with higher potentials, such as NAD(P)H or H(2) at $\le$ 100 kPa. These endergonic reactions are driven by concomitant oxidation of the same donor with higher potential acceptors such as crotonyl-CoA, NAD(+) or heterodisulfide (CoM-S-S-CoB). The process called flavin-based electron bifurcation (FBEB) can be regarded as a third mode of energy conservation in addition to substrate level phosphorylation (SLP) and electron transport phosphorylation (ETP). FBEB has been detected in the clostridial butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase/electron transferring flavoprotein complex (BcdA-EtfBC), the multisubunit [FeFe]hydrogenase from Thermotoga maritima (HydABC) and from acetogenic bacteria, the [NiFe]hydrogenase/heterodisulfide reductase (MvhADG-HdrABC) from methanogenic archaea, and the transhydrogenase (NfnAB) from many Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria and from anaerobic archaea. The Bcd/EtfBC complex that catalyzes electron bifurcation from NADH to the low potential ferredoxin and to the high potential crotonyl-CoA has already been studied in some detail. The bifurcating protein most likely is EtfBC, which in each subunit ($\beta$$\gamma$) contains one FAD. In analogy to the bifurcating complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and with the help of the structure of the human ETF, we propose a conformational change by which $\gamma$-FADH(-) in EtfBC approaches $\beta$-FAD to enable the bifurcating one-electron transfer. The ferredoxin reduced in one of the four electron bifurcating reactions can regenerate H(2) or NADPH, reduce CO(2) in acetogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea, or is converted to $\Delta$$\mu$H(+)/Na(+) by the membrane-associated enzyme complexes Rnf and Ech, whereby NADH and H(2) are recycled, respectively. The mainly bacterial Rnf complexes couple ferredoxin oxidation by NAD(+) with proton/sodium ion translocation and the more diverse energy converting [NiFe]hydrogenases (Ech) do the same, whereby NAD(+) is replaced by H(+). Many organisms also use Rnf and Ech in the reverse direction to reduce ferredoxin driven by $\Delta$$\mu$H(+)/Na(+). Finally examples are shown, in which the four bifurcating multienzyme complexes alone or together with Rnf and Ech are integrated into energy metabolisms of nine anaerobes.

abstract = {The mechanism by which the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is activated upon dimerization has eluded definition. We find that the EGFR kinase domain can be activated by increasing its local concentration or by mutating a leucine (L834R) in the activation loop, the phosphorylation of which is not required for activation. This suggests that the kinase domain is intrinsically autoinhibited, and an intermolecular interaction promotes its activation. Using further mutational analysis and crystallography we demonstrate that the autoinhibited conformation of the EGFR kinase domain resembles that of Src and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). EGFR activation results from the formation of an asymmetric dimer in which the C-terminal lobe of one kinase domain plays a role analogous to that of cyclin in activated CDK/cyclin complexes. The CDK/cyclin-like complex formed by two kinase domains thus explains the activation of EGFR-family receptors by homo- or heterodimerization.},

abstract = {As simulators attempt to replicate the dynamics of large cellular components in silico, problems related to sampling slow, glassy degrees of freedom in molecular systems will be amplified manyfold. It is tempting to augment simulation techniques with external biases to overcome such barriers with ease; biased simulations, however, offer little utility unless equilibrium properties of interest (both kinetic and thermodynamic) can be recovered from the data generated. In this Article, we present a general scheme that harnesses the power of Markov state models (MSMs) to extract equilibrium kinetic properties from molecular dynamics trajectories collected on biased potential energy surfaces. We first validate our reweighting protocol on a simple two-well potential, and we proceed to test our method on potential-biased simulations of the Trp-cage miniprotein. In both cases, we find that equilibrium populations, time scales, and dynamical processes are reliably reproduced as compared to gold standard, unbiased data sets. We go on to discuss the limitations of our dynamical reweighting approach, and we suggest auspicious target systems for further application.},

abstract = {The C5a chemoattractant factor receptor, when expressed in COS-7 cells, can stimulate phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C activity through the activation of the G16 isoform of the heterotrimeric G protein, but not through the G11 isoform. To identify the regions of the G alpha 16 subunit protein that are responsible for its activation by the C5a receptor, a series of chimeras between G alpha 16 and G alpha 11 were constructed and tested for their ability to be activated by the C5a receptor. Co-transfection experiments with chimeras in which the carboxyl-terminal regions of G alpha 11 were replaced with the corresponding regions of G alpha 16 demonstrated that changes in the carboxyl terminus, e.g., replacement of 134 amino acids, were not sufficient to confer receptor specificity. An additional segment encompassing residues 220-240 of G alpha 16 was required to confer C5a-induced activation. Testing of a reciprocal series of chimeras composed of G alpha 16 sequences at the amino terminus and G alpha 11 sequences at the carboxyl terminus revealed that certain sequences extending from the amino terminus to amino acid 209 of G alpha 16 were sufficient to endow the chimera with much of the specificity for C5a-induced activation. These results suggest that receptor specificity may involve specific conformations of the G protein stabilized by concerted interactions of multiple amino acid sequences distributed throughout the G alpha protein.},

abstract = {The minimum energy pathway contains important information describing the transition between two states on a potential energy surface (PES). Chain-of-states methods were developed to efficiently calculate minimum energy pathways connecting two stable states. In the chain-of-states framework, a series of structures are generated and optimized to represent the minimum energy pathway connecting two states. However, multiple pathways may exist connecting two existing states and should be identified to obtain a full view of the transitions. Therefore, we developed an enhanced sampling method, named as the direct pathway dynamics sampling (DPDS) method, to facilitate exploration of a PES for multiple pathways connecting two stable states as well as addition minima and their associated transition pathways. In the DPDS method, molecular dynamics simulations are carried out on the targeting PES within a chain-of-states framework to directly sample the transition pathway space. The simulations of DPDS could be regulated by two parameters controlling distance among states along the pathway and smoothness of the pathway. One advantage of the chain-of-states framework is that no specific reaction coordinates are necessary to generate the reaction pathway, because such information is implicitly represented by the structures along the pathway. The chain-of-states setup in a DPDS method greatly enhances the sufficient sampling in high-energy space between two end states, such as transition states. By removing the constraint on the end states of the pathway, DPDS will also sample pathways connecting minima on a PES in addition to the end points of the starting pathway. This feature makes DPDS an ideal method to directly explore transition pathway space. Three examples demonstrate the efficiency of DPDS methods in sampling the high-energy area important for reactions on the PES.},

In contrast, layered composite fluids are sometimes observed in confined systems of rather chaotic initial states, for example, lattes formed by pouring espresso into a glass of warm milk. Here, we report controlled experiments injecting a fluid into a miscible phase and show that, above a critical injection velocity, layering emerges over a time scale of minutes. We identify critical conditions to produce the layering, and relate the results quantitatively to double-diffusive convection. Based on this understanding, we show how to employ this single-step process to produce layered structures in soft materials, where the local elastic properties vary step-wise along the length of the material.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have become ubiquitous in all areas of life sciences. The size and model complexity of MD simulations are rapidly growing along with increasing computing power and improved algorithms. This growth has led to the production of a large amount of simulation data that need to be filtered for relevant information to address specific biomedical and biochemical questions. One of the most relevant molecular properties that can be investigated by all-atom MD simulations is the time-dependent evolution of the complex noncovalent interaction networks governing such fundamental aspects as molecular recognition, binding strength, and mechanical and structural stability. Extracting, evaluating, and visualizing noncovalent interactions is a key task in the daily work of structural biologists. We have developed PyContact, an easy-to-use, highly flexible, and intuitive graphical user interface-based application, designed to provide a toolkit to investigate biomolecular interactions in MD trajectories. PyContact is designed to facilitate this task by enabling identification of relevant noncovalent interactions in a comprehensible manner. The implementation of PyContact as a standalone application enables rapid analysis and data visualization without any additional programming requirements, and also preserves full in-program customization and extension capabilities for advanced users. The statistical analysis representation is interactively combined with full mapping of the results on the molecular system through the synergistic connection between PyContact and VMD. We showcase the capabilities and scientific significance of PyContact by analyzing and visualizing in great detail the noncovalent interactions underlying the ion permeation pathway of the human P2X3 receptor. As a second application, we examine the protein-protein interaction network of the mechanically ultrastable cohesin-dockering complex.},

We illustrate our approach with two classes of models. One depicts diffusion in a strong glass former, and the other in a fragile glass former. At low temperatures, both models exhibit violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation, D approximately tau(-1), where D is the self-diffusion constant and tau is the structural relaxation time. In the strong case, the violation is sensitive to dimensionality d, going as D approximately tau(-2/3) for d=1 and as D approximately tau(-0.95) for d=3. In the fragile case, however, we argue that dimensionality dependence is weak, and show that for d=1, D approximately tau(-0.73). This scaling for the fragile case compares favorably with the results of a recent experimental study for a three-dimensional fragile glass former.},

abstract = {Class B G-protein-coupled receptors are major targets for the treatment of chronic diseases, such as osteoporosis, diabetes and obesity. Here we report the structure of a full-length class B receptor, the calcitonin receptor, in complex with peptide ligand and heterotrimeric G$\alpha$s$\beta$$\gamma$ protein determined by Volta phase-plate single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The peptide agonist engages the receptor by binding to an extended hydrophobic pocket facilitated by the large outward movement of the extracellular ends of transmembrane helices 6 and 7. This conformation is accompanied by a 60{\textdegree} kink in helix 6 and a large outward movement of the intracellular end of this helix, opening the bundle to accommodate interactions with the $\alpha$5-helix of G$\alpha$s. Also observed is an extended intracellular helix 8 that contributes to both receptor stability and functional G-protein coupling via an interaction with the G$\beta$ subunit. This structure provides a new framework for understanding G-protein-coupled receptor function.},

abstract = {The role of structure and dynamics of an enzyme has been investigated at three different stages of its function including the chemical event it catalyzes. A one-pot computational method has been designed for each of these stages on the basis of classical and/or quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical molecular dynamics and transition path sampling simulations. For a pair of initial and final states A and B separated by a high free-energy barrier, using a two-stage selection process, several collective variables (CVs) are identified that can delineate A and B. However, these CVs are found to exhibit strong cross-coupling over the transition paths. A set of mutually orthogonal order parameters is then derived from these CVs and an optimal reaction coordinate, r, determined applying half-trajectory likelihood maximization along with a Bayesian information criterion. The transition paths are also used to project the multidimensional free energy surface and barrier crossing dynamics along r. The proposed scheme has been applied to the rate-determining intramolecular proton transfer reaction of the well-known enzyme human carbonic anhydrase II. The potential of mean force, F( r), in the absence of the chemical step is found to reproduce earlier results on the equilibrium population of two side-chain orientations of key residue His-64. Estimation of rate constants, k, from mean first passage times for the three different stages of catalysis shows that the rate-determining step of intramolecular proton transfer occurs with k ≃ 1.0 {\texttimes} 106s-1, in close agreement with known experimental results.},

abstract = {Protein structures are dynamic and can explore a large conformational landscape1,2. Only some of these structural substates are important for protein function (such as ligand binding, catalysis and regulation)3-5. How evolution shapes the structural ensemble to optimize a specific function is poorly understood3,4. One of the constraints on the evolution of proteins is the stability of the folded 'native' state. Despite this, 44% of the human proteome contains intrinsically disordered peptide segments greater than 30 residues in length6, the majority of which have no known function7-9. Here we show that the entropic force produced by an intrinsically disordered carboxy terminus (ID-tail) shifts the conformational ensemble of human UDP-$\alpha$-D-glucose-6-dehydrogenase (UGDH) towards a substate with a high affinity for an allosteric inhibitor. The function of the ID-tail does not depend on its sequence or chemical composition. Instead, the affinity enhancement can be accurately predicted based on the length of the intrinsically disordered segment, and is consistent with the entropic force generated by an unstructured peptide attached to the protein surface10-13. Our data show that the unfolded state of the ID-tail rectifies the dynamics and structure of UGDH to favour inhibitor binding. Because this entropic rectifier does not have any sequence or structural constraints, it is an easily acquired adaptation. This model implies that evolution selects for disordered segments to tune the energy landscape of proteins, which may explain the persistence of intrinsic disorder in the proteome.},

abstract = {Recent research has explored the increasingly important role of social media by examining the dynamics of individual and group behavior, characterizing patterns of information diffusion, and identifying influential individuals. In this paper we suggest a measure of causal relationships between nodes based on the information-theoretic notion of transfer entropy, or information transfer. This theoretically grounded measure is based on dynamic information, captures fine-grain notions of influence, and admits a natural, predictive interpretation. Causal networks inferred by transfer entropy can differ significantly from static friendship networks because most friendship links are not useful for predicting future dynamics. We demonstrate through analysis of synthetic and real-world data that transfer entropy reveals meaningful hidden network structures. In addition to altering our notion of who is influential, transfer entropy allows us to differentiate between weak influence over large groups and strong influence over small groups.},

abstract = {Interaction of light-activated rhodopsin with transducin (T) is the first event in visual signal transduction. We use covalent crosslinking approaches to map the contact sites in interaction between the two proteins. Here we use a photoactivatable reagent, N-[(2-pyridyldithio)-ethyl], 4-azido salicylamide. The reagent is attached to the SH group of cytoplasmic monocysteine rhodopsin mutants by a disulfide-exchange reaction with the pyridylthio group, and the derivatized rhodopsin then is complexed with T by illumination at lambda >495 nm. Subsequent irradiation of the complex at lambda310 nm generates covalent crosslinks between the two proteins. Crosslinking was demonstrated between T and a number of single cysteine rhodopsin mutants. However, sites of crosslinks were investigated in detail only between T and the rhodopsin mutant S240C (cytoplasmic loop V-VI). Crosslinking occurred predominantly with T(alpha). For identification of the sites of crosslinks in T(alpha), the strategy used involved: (i) derivatization of all of the free cysteines in the crosslinked proteins with N-ethylmaleimide; (ii) reduction of the disulfide bond linking the two proteins and isolation of all of the T(alpha) species carrying the crosslinked moiety with a free SH group; (iii) adduct formation of the latter with the N-maleimide moiety of the reagent, maleimido-butyryl-biocytin, containing a biotinyl group; (iv) trypsin degradation of the resulting T(alpha) derivatives and isolation of T(alpha) peptides carrying maleimido-butyryl-biocytin by avidin-agarose chromatography; and (v) identification of the isolated peptides by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We found that crosslinking occurred mainly to two C-terminal peptides in T(alpha) containing the amino acid sequences 310-313 and 342-345.},

In particular, binding of the medically important G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with intracellular signaling proteins has not been simulated with MD to date. Here, we report a successful simulation of the binding of a G-protein mimetic nanobody to the M2muscarinic GPCR using the robust Gaussian accelerated MD (GaMD) method. Through long-timescale GaMD simulations over 4,500 ns, the nanobody was observed to bind the receptor intracellular G-protein-coupling site, with a minimum rmsd of 2.48 {\AA} in the nanobody core domain compared with the X-ray structure. Binding of the nanobody allosterically closed the orthosteric ligand-binding pocket, being consistent with the recent experimental finding. In the absence of nanobody binding, the receptor orthosteric pocket sampled open and fully open conformations. The GaMD simulations revealed two low-energy intermediate states during nanobody binding to the M2receptor. The flexible receptor intracellular loops contribute remarkable electrostatic, polar, and hydrophobic residue interactions in recognition and binding of the nanobody. These simulations provided important insights into the mechanism of GPCR-nanobody binding and demonstrated the applicability of GaMD in modeling dynamic protein-protein interactions.},

We identified stabilization clusters in the GTPase and helical domains responsible for structural integrity and the conformational changes associated with activation. In activation cluster I, helices $\alpha$1 and $\alpha$5 pack against strands $\beta$1-$\beta$3 to stabilize the nucleotide-bound states. In the receptor-bound state, these interactions are replaced by interactions between $\alpha$5 and strands $\beta$4-$\beta$6. Key residues in this cluster are Y320, which is crucial for the stabilization of the receptor-bound state, and F336, which stabilizes nucleotide-bound states. Destabilization of helix $\alpha$1, caused by rearrangement of this activation cluster, leads to the weakening of the interdomain interface and release of GDP.},

However, the extent and generality of fitness effects resulting from cotranslational folding remain open questions. Here we report a genome-wide analysis that uncovers evidence of evolutionary selection for cotranslational folding. We describe a robust statistical approach to identify loci within genes that are both significantly enriched in slowly translated codons and evolutionarily conserved. Surprisingly, we find that domain boundaries can explain only a small fraction of these conserved loci. Instead, we propose that regions enriched in slowly translated codons are associated with cotranslational folding intermediates, which may be smaller than a single domain. We show that the intermediates predicted by a native-centric model of cotranslational folding account for the majority of these loci across more than 500 Escherichia coli proteins. By making a direct connection to protein folding, this analysis provides strong evidence that many synonymous substitutions have been selected to optimize translation rates at specific locations within genes. More generally, our results indicate that kinetics, and not just thermodynamics, can significantly alter the efficiency of self-assembly in a biological context.},

Due to conformational heterogeneity and inherent dynamics, structural studies of IDPs have relied mostly on NMR spectroscopy, despite IDPs having characteristics that make them challenging to study using traditional1H-detected biomolecular NMR techniques. Here, we develop a suite of 3D15N-detected experiments that take advantage of the slower transverse relaxation property of15N nuclei, the associated narrower linewidth, and the greater chemical shift dispersion compared with those of1H and13C resonances. The six 3D experiments described here start with aliphatic1H magnetization to take advantage of its higher initial polarization, and are broadly applicable for backbone assignment of proteins that are disordered, dynamic, or have unfavorable amide proton exchange rates. Using these experiments, backbone resonance assignments were completed for the unstructured regulatory domain (residues 131-294) of the human transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATC2), which includes 28 proline residues located in functionally important serine-proline (SP) repeats. The complete assignment of the NFATC2 regulatory domain enabled us to study phosphorylation of NFAT by kinase PKA and phosphorylation-dependent binding of chaperone protein 14-3-3 to NFAT, providing mechanistic insight on how 14-3-3 regulates NFAT nuclear translocation.},

abstract = {Because standard molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are unable to access time scales of interest in complex biomolecular systems, it is common to "stitch together" information from multiple shorter trajectories using approximate Markov state model (MSM) analysis. However, MSMs may require significant tuning and can yield biased results. Here, by analyzing some of the longest protein MD data sets available (>100 $\mu$s per protein), we show that estimators constructed based on exact non-Markovian (NM) principles can yield significantly improved mean first-passage times (MFPTs) for protein folding and unfolding. In some cases, MSM bias of more than an order of magnitude can be corrected when identical trajectory data are reanalyzed by non-Markovian approaches. The NM analysis includes "history" information, higher order time correlations compared to MSMs, that is available in every MD trajectory. The NM strategy is insensitive to fine details of the states used and works well when a fine time-discretization (i.e., small "lag time") is used.},

abstract = {The use of random, fractional 13C-enrichment combined with low pass filtration has allowed the determination of NMR relaxation parameters at an unprecedented number of sites within recombinant human ubiquitin. Essentially complete 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments for the protein are reported. Carbon spin lattice and heteronuclear NOE relaxation data have been analyzed in the context of the Lipari-Szabo "model free" formalism. The generalized order parameters for 56 main chain alpha C-H vectors have been determined and are found to correspond to the highly restricted motion seen in previous studies of the motion of amide N-H vectors. In distinct contrast, the analysis presented here indicates an unexpected range of dynamics within the interior of the protein. The generalized order parameters of 45 methyl groups of human ubiquitin have been determined. The methyl groups of Thr and Ala residues show generalized order parameters ranging from the Woessner limit (0.111) to below 0.01. Generalized order parameters for all methyl groups of the seven isoleucine residues were determined. With one exception, the generalized order parameters of the gamma methyls were equal to or greater than the corresponding delta methyls, indicating higher mobility away from the main chain. Generalized order parameters for 11 methyl groups of leucine residues were also determined. In six of the seven cases where the generalized order parameters of both prochiral methyl groups were determined, the pro-R methyl consistently shows a higher value than the pro-S methyl group. Generalized order parameters for seven methyl groups of four valines were also determined. There is no apparent correlation of methyl group prochirality with the value of the generalized order parameter. These data have several implications and generally indicate that the interior of the protein is heterogeneously dynamic.},

abstract = {<p>Conventional drug discovery efforts at the $\beta$<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor ($\beta$<sub>2</sub>AR) have led to the development of ligands that bind almost exclusively to the receptor9s hormone-binding orthosteric site. However, targeting the largely unexplored and evolutionarily unique allosteric sites has potential for developing more specific drugs with fewer side effects than orthosteric ligands. Using our recently developed approach for screening G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with DNA-encoded small molecule libraries, we have discovered and characterized the first $\beta$<sub>2</sub>AR small molecule positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) - compound-6 [(R)-N-(4-amino-1-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-4-oxobutan-2-yl)-5-(N-isopropyl-N-methylsulfamoyl)-2-((4-methoxyphenyl) thio)benzamide] and its analogs. We utilized purified human $\beta$<sub>2</sub>ARs, occupied by a high affinity agonist, for the affinity-based screening of over 500 million distinct library compounds, which yielded compound-6. It exhibits a low micro-molar affinity for the agonist-occupied $\beta$<sub>2</sub>AR, and displays positive cooperativity with orthosteric agonists, thereby enhancing their binding to the receptor and ability to stabilize its active state. Compound-6 is cooperative with G protein and $\beta$-arrestin1 (a.k.a. arrestin2) to stabilize high-affinity, agonist-bound active states of the $\beta$<sub>2</sub>AR, and potentiates downstream cAMP production and receptor-recruitment of $\beta$-arrestin2 (a.k.a. arrestin3). Compound-6 is specific for the $\beta$<sub>2</sub>AR compared to the closely related $\beta$<sub>1</sub>AR. Structure-activity studies of select compound-6 analogs defined the chemical groups that are critical for its biological activity. We thus introduce the first small molecule PAMs for the $\beta$<sub>2</sub>AR, which may serve as a lead molecule for the development of novel therapeutics. The approach described here establishes a broadly applicable proof-of-concept strategy for affinity-based discovery of small molecule allosteric compounds targeting unique conformational states of GPCRs.</p>},

abstract = {The cyclic depsipeptide FR900359 (FR), isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine plant Ardisia crenata, is a potent Gq protein inhibitor and thus a valuable tool to study Gq-mediated signaling of G protein-coupled receptors. Two new FR analogues (3 and 4) were isolated from A. crenata together with the known analogues 1 and 2. The structures of compounds 3 and 4 were established by NMR spectroscopic data and MS-based molecular networking followed by in-depth LCMS2 analysis. The latter approach led to the annotation of further FR analogues 5-9. Comparative bioactivity tests of compounds 1-4 along with the parent molecule FR showed high-affinity binding to Gq proteins in the low nanomolar range (IC50 = 2.3-16.8 nM) for all analogues as well as equipotent inhibition of Gq signaling, which gives important SAR insights into this valuable natural product. Additionally, FR was detected from leaves of five other Ardisia species, among them the non-nodulated leaves of Ardisia lucida, implying a much broader distribution of FR than originally anticipated.},

abstract = {There is abundant evidence for formation of G protein coupled receptor heteromers in heterologous expression systems, however, little is known of the function of heteromers in native systems. Heteromers of delta and kappa opioid receptors (DOR-KOR heteromers) have been identified in native systems. We previously reported that activation of DOR-KOR heteromers expressed by rat pain-sensing neurons (nociceptors) produces robust, peripherally-mediated antinociception. Moreover, DOR agonist potency and efficacy is regulated by KOR antagonists via allosteric interactions within the DOR-KOR heteromer in a ligand-dependent manner. Here we assessed the reciprocal regulation of KOR agonist function by DOR antagonists in adult rat nociceptors in culture and in a behavioral assay of nociception. Naltrindole enhanced the potency of the KOR agonist ICI-199441 (10-20 fold), but did not alter responses to U50488. By contrast, the potency of U50488 was enhanced (20 fold) by 7-benzylidenenaltrexone. The efficacy of 6'-guanidinonaltrindole (6'-GNTI) to inhibit nociceptors was blocked by siRNA knock-down of DOR or KOR. Replacing 6'-GNTI occupancy of DOR with either naltrindole or 7-benzylidenenaltrexone abolished 6'-GNTI efficacy. Further, peptides derived from DOR transmembrane segment 1, fused to the cell membrane penetrating HIV transactivator of transcription peptide, also blocked 6'-GNTI-mediated responses ex vivo and in vivo, suggesting that 6'-GNTI efficacy in nociceptors is due to its positive allosteric regulation of KOR via occupancy of DOR in a DOR-KOR heteromer. Together, these results provide evidence for the existence of functional DOR-KOR heteromers in rat peripheral sensory neurons and that reciprocal, ligand-dependent, allosteric interactions occur between the DOR and KOR protomers.},

abstract = {Molecular recognition is determined by the structure and dynamics of both a protein and its ligand, but it is difficult to directly assess the role of each of these players. In this study, we use Markov State Models (MSMs) built from atomistic simulations to elucidate the mechanism by which the Lysine-, Arginine-, Ornithine-binding (LAO) protein binds to its ligand. We show that our model can predict the bound state, binding free energy, and association rate with reasonable accuracy and then use the model to dissect the binding mechanism. In the past, this binding event has often been assumed to occur via an induced fit mechanism because the protein's binding site is completely closed in the bound state, making it impossible for the ligand to enter the binding site after the protein has adopted the closed conformation. More complex mechanisms have also been hypothesized, but these have remained controversial. Here, we are able to directly observe roles for both the conformational selection and induced fit mechanisms in LAO binding. First, the LAO protein tends to form a partially closed encounter complex via conformational selection (that is, the apo protein can sample this state), though the induced fit mechanism can also play a role here. Then, interactions with the ligand can induce a transition to the bound state. Based on these results, we propose that MSMs built from atomistic simulations may be a powerful way of dissecting ligand-binding mechanisms and may eventually facilitate a deeper understanding of allostery as well as the prediction of new protein-ligand interactions, an important step in drug discovery.},

Using the S(2) order parameter and a surrogate for the protein enthalpy in conjunction with metadynamics or variationally enhanced sampling, we are able to reversibly fold and unfold a small protein and draw its free energy at a fraction of the time that is needed in unbiased simulations. We also use S(2) in combination with the free energy flooding method to compute the unfolding rate of this peptide.

abstract = {Time-correlated atomic motions were used to characterize protein domain boundaries from atomic coordinates generated by molecular dynamics simulations. A novel application of the dynamical cross-correlation matrix (DCCM) analysis tool was used to help identify putative protein domains. In implementing this new approach, several DCCM maps were calculated, each using a different coordinate reference frame from which protein domain boundaries and protein domain residue constituents could be identified. Cytochrome P450BM-3, from Bacillus megaterium, was used as the model protein in this study. The analyses indicated that the simulated protein comprises three distinct domain regions; in contrast, only two protein domains were identified in the original crystal structure report. Specifically, the DCCM analyses showed that the F-G helix region was a separate domain entity and not a part of the alpha domain, as previously designated. The simulations demonstrated that the domain motions of the F-G helix region effected both the size and shape of the enzyme active site, and that the dynamics of the F-G helix domain could possibly control access of substrate to the binding pocket.},

abstract = {The effects of substrate binding on class A $\beta$-lactamase dynamics were studied using molecular dynamics simulations of two model enzymes; 40 100-ns trajectories of the free and substrate-bound forms of TEM-1 (with benzylpenicillin) and PSE-4 (with carbenicillin) were recorded (totaling 4.0 $\mu$s). Substrates were parameterized with the CHARMM General Force Field. In both enzymes, the $\Omega$ loop exhibits a marked flexibility increase upon substrate binding, supporting the hypothesis of substrate gating. However, specific interactions that are formed or broken in the $\Omega$ loop upon binding differ between the two enzymes: dynamics are conserved, but not specific interactions. Substrate binding also has a global structuring effect on TEM-1, but not on PSE-4. Changes in TEM-1's normal modes show long-range effects of substrate binding on enzyme dynamics. Hydrogen bonds observed in the active site are mostly preserved upon substrate binding, and new, transient interactions are also formed.~Agreement between NMR relaxation parameters and our theoretical results highlights the dynamic duality of class A $\beta$-lactamases: enzymes that are highly structured on the ps-ns timescale, with important flexibility on the $\mu$s-ms timescale in regions such as the $\Omega$ loop.},

Thermally driven dynamics on different timescales have been experimentally observed or simulated, and a direct link between micro- to milli-second domain motions and enzymatic function has been established. However, very little is understood about the connection of these functionally relevant, collective movements with local atomic fluctuations, which are much faster. Here we show that pico- to nano-second timescale atomic fluctuations in hinge regions of adenylate kinase facilitate the large-scale, slower lid motions that produce a catalytically competent state. The fast, local mobilities differ between a mesophilic and hyperthermophilic adenylate kinase, but are strikingly similar at temperatures at which enzymatic activity and free energy of folding are matched. The connection between different timescales and the corresponding amplitudes of motions in adenylate kinase and their linkage to catalytic function is likely to be a general characteristic of protein energy landscapes.},

abstract = {Allostery can occur by way of subtle cooperation among protein residues (e.g., amino acids) even in the absence of large conformational shifts. Dynamical network analysis has been used to model this cooperation, helping to computationally explain how binding to an allosteric site can impact the behavior of a primary site many {\aa}ngstroms away. Traditionally, computational efforts have focused on the most optimal path of correlated motions leading from the allosteric to the primary active site. We present a program called Weighted Implementation of Suboptimal Paths (WISP) capable of rapidly identifying additional suboptimal pathways that may also play important roles in the transmission of allosteric signals. Aside from providing signal redundancy, suboptimal paths traverse residues that, if disrupted through pharmacological or mutational means, could modulate the allosteric regulation of important drug targets. To demonstrate the utility of our program, we present a case study describing the allostery of HisH-HisF, an amidotransferase from T. maritima thermotiga.

However, whether RAMP-GPCR interactions are widespread, and the nature of their functional consequences, remains largely unknown. In humans, there are three RAMPs and over 800 expressed GPCRs, making direct experimental approaches challenging. We analyzed relevant genomic data from all currently available sequenced organisms. We discovered that RAMPs and GPCRs tend to have orthologs in the same species and have correlated phylogenetic trees to the same extent, or higher than other interacting protein pairs that play key roles in cellular signaling. In addition, the resulting RAMP-GPCR interaction map suggests that RAMP1 and RAMP3 interact with the same set of GPCRs, which implies functional redundancy. We next analyzed human transcriptomes and found expression correlation for GPCRs and RAMPs. Our results suggest global coevolution of GPCRs and RAMPS and support the hypothesis that GPCRs interact globally with RAMPs in cellular signaling pathways.},

abstract = {Cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) from Escherichia coli is assumed to exist in two states, namely, those represented by the free protein and that of the ligand-protein complex. To establish a quantitative structure-function relation between cAMP binding and the cAMP-induced conformational changes in the receptor, protein conformational change was quantitated as a function of cAMP concentration up to 10 mM. The protein conformation was monitored by four different methods at pH 7.8 and 23 degrees C, namely, rate of proteolytic digestion by subtilisin, rate of chemical modification of Cys-178, tryptophan fluorescence, and fluorescence of the extrinsic fluorescence probe 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS). Each of these techniques reveals a biphasic dependence of protein conformation on cAMP concentration. At low cAMP concentrations ranging from 0 to 200 microM, the rates of proteolytic digestion and that of Cys-178 modification increase, whereas the fluorescence intensity of the ANS-protein complex is quenched, and there is no change in the fluorescence intensity of the tryptophan residues in the protein. At higher cAMP concentrations, the rates of proteolytic and chemical modification of the protein decrease, while the fluorescence intensity of the ANS-protein complex is further quenched but there is an increase in the intensity of tryptophan fluorescence. These results show unequivocally that there are at least three conformational states of the protein. The association constants for the formation of CRP-cAMP and CRP-(cAMP)2 complexes derived from conformational studies are in good agreement with those determined by equilibrium dialysis, nonequilibrium dialysis, and ultrafiltration. Therefore, the simplest explanation would be that the protein exhibits three conformational states, free CRP and two cAMP-dependent states, which correspond to the CRP-cAMP and CRP-(cAMP)2 complexes. The binding properties of CRP-cAMP and CRP-(cAMP)2 to the lac promoter were studied by using the gel retardation technique. At a high concentration of cAMP which favors the formation of the CRP-(cAMP)2 complex, binding of the protein to DNA is decreased. This, together with conformational data, strongly suggests that only the CRP-cAMP complex is active in specific DNA binding whereas CRP and CRP-(cAMP)2 are not.},

G(alpha)(o) and G(alpha)(i1) display a 5-fold difference in the rate of GDP dissociation with half-times of 2.3 +/- 0.2 and 10.4 +/- 1.3 min, respectively. To identify molecular determinants of the GDP release rate, we evaluated the rate of binding of the fluorescent guanine nucleotide 2'(3')-O-(N-methyl-3'-anthraniloyl)guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (mGTPgammaS) to chimers of G(alpha)(o) and G(alpha)(i1). Although no one region of the G protein determined the GDP dissociation rate, when the C-terminal 123 amino acids in G(alpha)(i1) were replaced with those of G(alpha)(o), the GDP release rate increased 3.3-fold compared to that of wild-type G(alpha)(i1). Within the C-terminal portion, modification of four amino acids in a coil between beta4 and the alpha3 helix resulted in GDP release kinetics identical to those of wild-type G(alpha)(o). Based on the G(alpha)(i1)-GDP crystal structure of this region, Leu(232) appeared to form a hydrophobic contact with Arg(144) of the helical domain. The role of this interaction was confirmed by G(alpha)(i1) L232Q and G(alpha)(i1) R144A which displayed 2-5-fold faster GDP release rates compared to wild-type G(alpha)(i1) (t(1/2) 4.7 and 1.5 min, respectively), suggesting that interdomain bridging contacts partially determine the basal rate of GDP release from heterotrimeric G proteins.},

abstract = {The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a brain region important for regulating anxiety-related behavior in both humans and rodents. Here we used a chemogenetic strategy to investigate how engagement of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling cascades in genetically defined GABAergic BNST neurons modulates anxiety-related behavior and downstream circuit function. We saw that stimulation of vesicular $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter (VGAT)-expressing BNST neurons using hM3Dq, but neither hM4Di nor rM3Ds designer receptors exclusively activated by a designer drug (DREADD), promotes anxiety-like behavior. Further, we identified that activation of hM3Dq receptors in BNST VGAT neurons can induce a long-term depression-like state of glutamatergic synaptic transmission, indicating DREADD-induced changes in synaptic plasticity. Further, we used DREADD-assisted metabolic mapping to profile brain-wide network activity following activation of Gq-mediated signaling in BNST VGAT neurons and saw increased activity within ventral midbrain structures, including the ventral tegmental area and hindbrain structures such as the locus coeruleus and parabrachial nucleus. These results highlight that Gq-mediated signaling in BNST VGAT neurons can drive downstream network activity that correlates with anxiety-like behavior and points to the importance of identifying endogenous GPCRs within genetically defined cell populations. We next used a microfluidics approach to profile the receptorome of single BNST VGAT neurons. This approach yielded multiple Gq-coupled receptors that are associated with anxiety-like behavior and several potential novel candidates for regulation of anxiety-like behavior. From this, we identified that stimulation of the Gq-coupled receptor 5-HT2CR in the BNST is sufficient to elevate anxiety-like behavior in an acoustic startle task. Together, these results provide a novel profile of receptors within genetically defined BNST VGAT neurons that may serve as therapeutic targets for regulating anxiety states and provide a blueprint for examining how G-protein-mediated signaling in a genetically defined cell type can be used to assess behavior and brain-wide circuit function.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 13 December 2016; doi:10.1038/mp.2016.218.},

abstract = {Here we propose the Reweighted Autoencoded Variational Bayes for Enhanced Sampling (RAVE) method, a new iterative scheme that uses the deep learning framework of variational autoencoders to enhance sampling in molecular simulations. RAVE involves iterations between molecular simulations and deep learning in order to produce an increasingly accurate probability distribution along a low-dimensional latent space that captures the key features of the molecular simulation trajectory. Using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between this latent space distribution and the distribution of various trial reaction coordinates sampled from the molecular simulation, RAVE determines an optimum, yet nonetheless physically interpretable, reaction coordinate and optimum probability distribution. Both then directly serve as the biasing protocol for a new biased simulation, which is once again fed into the deep learning module with appropriate weights accounting for the bias, the procedure continuing until estimates of desirable thermodynamic observables are converged. Unlike recent methods using deep learning for enhanced sampling purposes, RAVE stands out in that (a) it naturally produces a physically interpretable reaction coordinate, (b) is independent of existing enhanced sampling protocols to enhance the fluctuations along the latent space identified via deep learning, and (c) it provides the ability to easily filter out spurious solutions learned by the deep learning procedure. The usefulness and reliability of RAVE is demonstrated by applying it to model potentials of increasing complexity, including computation of the binding free energy profile for a hydrophobic ligand-substrate system in explicit water with dissociation time of more than three minutes, in computer time at least twenty times less than that needed for umbrella sampling or metadynamics.},

abstract = {Gramicidin A, a topical antibiotic made from alternating L and D amino acids, is characterized by its wide central pore; upon insertion into membranes, it forms channels that disrupts ion gradients. We present helical peptidomimetics with this characteristic wide central pore that have been designed to mimic gramicidin A channels. Mimetics were designed using molecular modeling focused on oligomers of heterochiral dipeptides of proline analogs, in particular azaproline (AzPro). Molecular Dynamics simulations in water confirmed the stability of the designed helices. A sixteen-residue Formyl-(AzPro-Pro)8-NHCH2CH2OH helix was synthesized as well as a full thirty-two residue Cbz-(AzPro-Pro)16-OtBu channels. No liposomal lysis activity was observed suggesting lack of channel formation, possibly due to inappropriate hydrogen-bonding interactions in the membrane. These peptidomimetics also did not hemolyze red blood cells, unlike gramicidin A.},

abstract = {Mixed-chirality peptide macrocycles such as cyclosporine are among the most potent therapeutics identified to date, but there is currently no way to systematically search the structural space spanned by such compounds. Natural proteins do not provide a useful guide: Peptide macrocycles lack regular secondary structures and hydrophobic cores, and can contain local structures not accessible with l-amino acids. Here, we enumerate the stable structures that can be adopted by macrocyclic peptides composed of l- and d-amino acids by near-exhaustive backbone sampling followed by sequence design and energy landscape calculations. We identify more than 200 designs predicted to fold into single stable structures, many times more than the number of currently available unbound peptide macrocycle structures. Nuclear magnetic resonance structures of 9 of 12 designed 7- to 10-residue macrocycles, and three 11- to 14-residue bicyclic designs, are close to the computational models. Our results provide a nearly complete coverage of the rich space of structures possible for short peptide macrocycles and vastly increase the available starting scaffolds for both rational drug design and library selection methods.},

abstract = {Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) exist in physiological solution mostly bound to cations. Interestingly, their cellular Mg2+-bound forms have been shown to bind Li+, a first-line drug for bipolar disorder. However, solution structures of NTP/NDP (N = A or G) bound to Li+ and/or Mg2+ have not been solved, thus precluding knowledge of how the native Mg2+-bound cofactor conformation changes upon binding non-native Li+ and/or switching its environment from aqueous solution to proteins. Using well-calibrated methods that reproduce experimental structural and thermodynamic parameters of several Mg2+/Li+-nucleotide complexes, we show that the native NTP/NDP-Mg2+ cofactor adopts a "folded" conformation in water that remains unperturbed upon Li+ binding. We further show that the "folded" solution conformation fits nicely into the ATP-binding pockets of P2X receptors, but not the elongated pockets of GTP-binding proteins. Implications of the findings on how Li+, in its bound state, can manifest its therapeutic effects are discussed.},

abstract = {The use of free-energy landscapes rationalizes a wide range of aspects of protein behavior by providing a clear illustration of the different states accessible to these molecules, as well as of their populations and pathways of interconversion. The determination of the free-energy landscapes of proteins by computational methods is, however, very challenging as it requires an extensive sampling of their conformational spaces. We describe here a technique to achieve this goal with relatively limited computational resources by incorporating nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts as collective variables in metadynamics simulations. As in this approach the chemical shifts are not used as structural restraints, the resulting free-energy landscapes correspond to the force fields used in the simulations. We illustrate this approach in the case of the third Ig-binding domain of protein G from streptococcal bacteria (GB3). Our calculations reveal the existence of a folding intermediate of GB3 with nonnative structural elements. Furthermore, the availability of the free-energy landscape enables the folding mechanism of GB3 to be elucidated by analyzing the conformational ensembles corresponding to the native, intermediate, and unfolded states, as well as the transition states between them. Taken together, these results show that, by incorporating experimental data as collective variables in metadynamics simulations, it is possible to enhance the sampling efficiency by two or more orders of magnitude with respect to standard molecular dynamics simulations, and thus to estimate free-energy differences among the different states of a protein with a k(B)T accuracy by generating trajectories of just a few microseconds.},

Here we investigate the interplay of conformational change and ligand-binding kinetics for the serine protease Trypsin and its competitive inhibitor Benzamidine with an extensive set of 150 $\mu$s molecular dynamics simulation data, analysed using a Markov state model. Seven metastable conformations with different binding pocket structures are found that interconvert at timescales of tens of microseconds. These conformations differ in their substrate-binding affinities and binding/dissociation rates. For each metastable state, corresponding solved structures of Trypsin mutants or similar serine proteases are contained in the protein data bank. Thus, our wild-type simulations explore a space of conformations that can be individually stabilized by adding ligands or making suitable changes in protein sequence. These findings provide direct evidence of conformational plasticity in receptors.},

In standard metadynamics, the free-energy surface is filled by the addition of Gaussian potentials of preassigned and typically diagonal covariance. Asymptotically the free-energy surface is proportional to the bias deposited. Here, we consider the possibility of using Gaussians whose variance is adjusted on the fly to the local properties of the free-energy surface. We suggest two different prescriptions: one is based on the local diffusivity and the other on the local geometrical properties. We further examine the problem of extracting the free-energy surface when using adaptive Gaussians. We show that the standard relation between the bias and the free energy does not hold. In the limit of narrow Gaussians an explicit correction can be evaluated. In the general case, we propose to use instead a relation between bias and free energy borrowed from ...},

Protein dynamics is recognized as important, but due to the inherent flexibility of biological macromolecules it is often difficult to distinguish which conformational changes are directly related to function. Here, we use directed evolution on an impaired mutant of the proline isomerase CypA and identify two second-shell mutations that partially restore its catalytic activity. We show both kinetically, using NMR spectroscopy, and structurally, by room-temperature X-ray crystallography, how local perturbations propagate through a large allosteric network to facilitate conformational dynamics. The increased catalysis selected for in the evolutionary screen is correlated with an accelerated interconversion between the two catalytically essential conformational sub-states, which are both captured in the high-resolution X-ray ensembles. Our data provide a glimpse of an evolutionary trajectory and show how subtle changes can fine-tune enzyme function.},

abstract = {Meaningful efforts in computer-aided drug design (CADD) require accurate molecular mechanical force fields to quantitatively characterize protein{\textendash}ligand interactions, ligand hydration free energies, and other ligand physical properties. Atomic models of new compounds are commonly generated by analogy from the predefined tabulated parameters of a given force field. Two widely used approaches following this strategy are the General Amber Force Field (GAFF) and the CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF). An important limitation of using pretabulated parameter values is that they may be inadequate in the context of a specific molecule. To resolve this issue, we previously introduced the General Automated Atomic Model Parameterization (GAAMP) for automatically generating the parameters of atomic models of small molecules, using the results from ab initio quantum mechanical (QM) calculations as target data. The GAAMP protocol uses QM data to optimize the bond, valence angle, and dihedral angle internal parameters,...},

abstract = {Thymidylate is a critical DNA nucleotide that has to be synthesized in cells de novo by all organisms. Flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase (FDTS) catalyzes the final step in this de novo production of thymidylate in many human pathogens, but it is absent from humans. The FDTS reaction proceeds via a chemical route that is different from its human enzyme analogue, making FDTS a potential antimicrobial target. The chemical mechanism of FDTS is still not understood, and the two most recently proposed mechanisms involve reaction intermediates that are unusual in pyrimidine biosynthesis and biology in general. These mechanisms differ in the relative timing of the reaction of the flavin with the substrate. The consequence of this difference is significant: the intermediates are cationic in one case and neutral in the other, an important consideration in the construction of mechanism-based enzyme inhibitors. Here we test these mechanisms via chemical trapping of reaction intermediates, stopped-flow, and substrate hydrogen isotope exchange techniques. Our findings suggest that an initial activation of the pyrimidine substrate by reduced flavin is required for catalysis, and a revised mechanism is proposed on the basis of previous and new data. These findings and the newly proposed mechanism add an important piece to the puzzle of the mechanism of FDTS and suggest a new class of intermediates that, in the future, may serve as targets for mechanism-based design of FDTS-specific inhibitors.},

abstract = {Protein structure refinement by direct global energy optimization has been a longstanding challenge in computational structural biology due to limitations in both energy function accuracy and conformational sampling. This manuscript demonstrates that with recent advances in both areas, refinement can significantly improve protein comparative models based on structures of distant homologues. Proteins fold to their lowest free-energy structures, and hence the most straightforward way to increase the accuracy of a partially incorrect protein structure model is to search for the lowest-energy nearby structure. This direct approach has met with little success for two reasons: first, energy function inaccuracies can lead to false energy minima, resulting in model degradation rather than improvement; and second, even with an accurate energy function, the search problem is formidable because the energy only drops considerably in the immediate vicinity of the global minimum, and there are a very large number of degrees of freedom. Here we describe a large-scale energy optimization-based refinement method that incorporates advances in both search and energy function accuracy that can substantially improve the accuracy of low-resolution homology models. The method refined low-resolution homology models into correct folds for 50 of 84 diverse protein families and generated improved models in recent blind structure prediction experiments. Analyses of the basis for these improvements reveal contributions from both the improvements in conformational sampling techniques and the energy function.},

abstract = {Several domains of G protein alpha subunits are implicated in the control of receptor-G protein coupling specificity. Among these are the extreme N-and C-termini, the alpha4/beta6-loops, and the loop linking the N-terminal alpha-helix to the beta1-strand of the ras-like domain. In this study, we illustrate that single-point mutations of a highly conserved glycine residue within the linker I region of the Galpha(q) subunit confers upon the mutant Galpha(q) the ability to be activated by Galpha(i)- and Galpha(s) -coupled receptors, as evidenced by guanosine 5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio)triphosphate binding and inositol phosphate turnover assays. The mutations did not affect expression of Galpha(q) proteins nor their ability to stimulate phospholipase Cbeta. It is noteworthy that both mutant and wild-type Galpha(q) proteins are indistinguishable in their ability to reconstitute a functional Gq-PLCbeta-calcium signaling pathway when cotransfected with the Galpha(q)-coupled neurokinin 1 or muscarinic M3 receptor into mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from Galpha(q/11) knockout mice. On a three-dimensional model of the receptor-G protein complex, the highly conserved linker I region connecting the helical and the GTPase domain of the Galpha protein is inaccessible to the intracellular surface of the receptors. Our data indicate that receptor-G protein coupling specificity is not exclusively governed by direct receptor-G protein interaction and that it even bypasses the requirement of the extreme C terminus of Galpha, a well accepted receptor recognition domain, suggesting a novel allosteric mechanism for G protein-coupled receptor-G protein selectivity.},

All six tryptophan indole and eight glycine backbone 15N-1H NMR signals in A2AAR were individually assigned. These NMR probes provided insight into the role of Asp522.50 as~an allosteric link between the orthosteric drug binding site and the intracellular signaling surface, revealing strong interactions with the toggle switch Trp 2466.48, and delineated the structural response to variable efficacy of bound drugs across A2AAR.

abstract = {Arrestins regulate the signaling of ligand-activated, phosphorylated G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Different patterns of receptor phosphorylation (phosphorylation barcode) can modulate arrestin conformations, resulting in distinct functional outcomes (for example, desensitization, internalization, and downstream signaling). However, the mechanism of arrestin activation and how distinct receptor phosphorylation patterns could induce different conformational changes on arrestin are not fully understood. We analyzed how each arrestin amino acid contributes to its different conformational states. We identified a conserved structural motif that restricts the mobility of the arrestin finger loop in the inactive state and appears to be regulated by receptor phosphorylation. Distal and proximal receptor phosphorylation sites appear to selectively engage with distinct arrestin structural motifs (that is, micro-locks) to induce different arrestin conformations. These observations suggest a model in which different phosphorylation patterns of the GPCR C terminus can combinatorially modulate the conformation of the finger loop and other phosphorylation-sensitive structural elements to drive distinct arrestin conformation and functional outcomes.},

abstract = {The G protein transducin has been an often-used model for biochemical, structural, and mechanistic studies of G protein function. Experimental studies have been limited, however, by the inability to express quantities of mutants in heterologous systems with ease. In this study we have made a series of G alpha t/G alpha i1 chimeras differing at as few as 11 positions from native G alpha t. Ten chimeras are properly folded, contain GDP, can assume an A1F4(-)-induced activated conformation, and interact with beta gamma t and light-activated rhodopsin. They differ dramatically in their affinity for GDP, from Gi-like (initial rates 225 mumol/mol s) to Gt-like (initial rates 4.9 mumol/mol s). We have used these chimeras to define contact sites on G alpha t with the effector enzyme cGMP phosphodiesterase. G alpha t GTP but not G alpha t GDP activates it by removing the phosphodiesterase (PDE) gamma inhibitory subunit. In solution, G alpha t GTP interacts with PDE gamma (Kd 12 nM), while G alpha t GDP binds PDE gamma more weakly (Kd 0.88 microM). The interaction of G alpha i GDP with PDE gamma is undetectable, but G alpha i GDP-A1F4- interacts weakly with PDE gamma (Kd 2.4 microM). Using defined G alpha t/G alpha i chimeras, we have individuated the regions on G alpha t most important for interaction with PDE gamma in the basal and activated states. The G alpha t sequence encompassing alpha helix 3 and the alpha 3/beta 5 loop contributes most binding energy to interaction with PDE gamma. Another composite P gamma interaction site is the conserved switch, through which the GTP-bound G alpha t as well as G alpha i1 interact with P gamma. Competition studies between PDE gamma and truncated regions of PDE gamma provide evidence for the point-to-point interactions between the two proteins. The amino-terminal 1-45 segment containing the central polycationic region binds to G alpha t's alpha 3 helix and alpha 3/beta 5 loop, while the COOH-terminal region of P gamma, 63-87, binds in concert to the conserved switch regions. The first interaction provides specific interaction with both the GDP- and GTP-liganded G alpha t, while the second one is conserved between G alpha t and G alpha i1 and dependent on the activated conformation.},

abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) frequently function in protein interaction networks that regulate crucial cellular signaling pathways. Many IDPs undergo transitions from disordered conformational ensembles to folded structures upon binding to their cellular targets. Several possible binding mechanisms for coupled folding and binding have been identified: folding of the IDP after association with the target ("induced fit"), or binding of a prefolded state in the conformational ensemble of the IDP to the target protein ("conformational selection"), or some combination of these two extremes. The interaction of the intrinsically disordered phosphorylated kinase-inducible domain (pKID) of the cAMP-response element binding (CREB) protein with the KIX domain of a general transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) provides an example of the induced-fit mechanism. Here we show by NMR relaxation dispersion experiments that a different intrinsically disordered ligand, the transactivation domain of the transcription factor c-Myb, interacts with KIX at the same site as pKID but via a different binding mechanism that involves elements of conformational selection and induced fit. In contrast to pKID, the c-Myb activation domain has a strong propensity for spontaneous helix formation in its N-terminal region, which binds to KIX in a predominantly folded conformation. The C-terminal region of c-Myb exhibits a much smaller helical propensity and likely folds via an induced-fit process after binding to KIX. We propose that the intrinsic secondary structure propensities of pKID and c-Myb determine their binding mechanisms, consistent with their functions as inducible and constitutive transcriptional activators.},

The measure reveals how correlated motions are used to transmit information through the system, and helps to clarify the link between correlated motions and biological function in biomolecular systems. The method is illustrated by its application to the Ets-1 transcription factor, which partially unfolds upon binding DNA. The calculations show dramatic changes in the direction of information flow upon DNA binding, and elucidate how the presence of DNA is communicated from the DNA binding H1 and H3 helices to inhibitory helix HI-1.

abstract = {It has recently been proposed by Gunasakaran et al. that allostery may be an intrinsic property of all proteins. Here, we develop a computational method that can determine and quantify allosteric activity in any given protein. Based on Schreiber's transfer entropy formulation, our approach leads to an information transfer landscape for the protein that shows the presence of entropy sinks and sources and explains how pairs of residues communicate with each other using entropy transfer. The model can identify the residues that drive the fluctuations of others. We apply the model to Ubiquitin, whose allosteric activity has not been emphasized until recently, and show that there are indeed systematic pathways of entropy and information transfer between residues that correlate well with the activities of the protein. We use 600 nanosecond molecular dynamics trajectories for Ubiquitin and its complex with human polymerase iota and evaluate entropy transfer between all pairs of residues of Ubiquitin and quantify the binding susceptibility changes upon complex formation. We explain the complex formation propensities of Ubiquitin in terms of entropy transfer. Important residues taking part in allosteric communication in Ubiquitin predicted by our approach are in agreement with results of NMR relaxation dispersion experiments. Finally, we show that time delayed correlation of fluctuations of two interacting residues possesses an intrinsic causality that tells which residue controls the interaction and which one is controlled. Our work shows that time delayed correlations, entropy transfer and causality are the required new concepts for explaining allosteric communication in proteins.},

abstract = {The rapidly expanding body of available genomic and protein structural data provides a rich resource for understanding protein dynamics with biomolecular simulation. While computational infrastructure has grown rapidly, simulations on an omics scale are not yet widespread, primarily because software infrastructure to enable simulations at this scale has not kept pace. It should now be possible to study protein dynamics across entire (super)families, exploiting both available structural biology data and conformational similarities across homologous proteins. Here, we present a new tool for enabling high-throughput simulation in the genomics era. Ensembler takes any set of sequences-from a single sequence to an entire superfamily-and shepherds them through various stages of modeling and refinement to produce simulation-ready structures. This includes comparative modeling to all relevant PDB structures (which may span multiple conformational states of interest), reconstruction of missing loops, addition of missing atoms, culling of nearly identical structures, assignment of appropriate protonation states, solvation in explicit solvent, and refinement and filtering with molecular simulation to ensure stable simulation. The output of this pipeline is an ensemble of structures ready for subsequent molecular simulations using computer clusters, supercomputers, or distributed computing projects like Folding@home. Ensembler thus automates much of the time-consuming process of preparing protein models suitable for simulation, while allowing scalability up to entire superfamilies. A particular advantage of this approach can be found in the construction of kinetic models of conformational dynamics-such as Markov state models (MSMs)-which benefit from a diverse array of initial configurations that span the accessible conformational states to aid sampling. We demonstrate the power of this approach by constructing models for all catalytic domains in the human tyrosine kinase family, using all available kinase catalytic domain structures from any organism as structural templates.

abstract = {Allostery in a protein involves effector binding at an allosteric site that changes the structure and/or dynamics at a distant, functional site. In addition to the chemical equilibrium of ligand binding, allostery involves a conformational equilibrium between one protein substate that binds the effector and a second substate that less strongly binds the effector. We run molecular dynamics simulations using simple, smooth energy landscapes to sample specific ligand-induced conformational transitions, as defined by the effector-bound and effector-unbound protein structures. These simulations can be performed using our web server (http://salilab.org/allosmod/). We then develop a set of features to analyze the simulations and capture the relevant thermodynamic properties of the allosteric conformational equilibrium. These features are based on molecular mechanics energy functions, stereochemical effects, and structural/dynamic coupling between sites. Using a machine-learning algorithm on a data set of 10 proteins and 179 mutations, we predict both the magnitude and the sign of the allosteric conformational equilibrium shift by the mutation; the impact of a large identifiable fraction of the mutations can be predicted with an average unsigned error of 1k(B)T. With similar accuracy, we predict the mutation effects for an 11th protein that was omitted from the initial training and testing of the machine-learning algorithm. We also assess which calculated thermodynamic properties contribute most to the accuracy of the prediction.},

abstract = {In a typical single-molecule force spectroscopy experiment, the ends of the molecule of interest are connected by long polymer linkers to a pair of mesoscopic beads trapped in the focus of two laser beams. At constant force load, the total extension, i.e., the end-to-end distance of the molecule plus linkers, is measured as a function of time. In the simplest systems, the measured extension fluctuates about two values characteristic of folded and unfolded states, with occasional transitions between them. We have recently shown that molecular (un)folding rates can be recovered from such trajectories, with a small linker correction, as long as the characteristic time of the bead fluctuations is shorter than the residence time in the unfolded (folded) state. Here, we show that accurate measurements of the molecular transition path times require an even faster apparatus response. Transition paths, the trajectory segments in which the molecule (un)folds, are properly resolved only if the beads fluctuate more rapidly than the end-to-end distance of the molecule. Therefore, over a wide regime, the measured rates may be meaningful but not the transition path times. Analytic expressions for the measured mean transition path times are obtained for systems diffusing anisotropically on a two-dimensional free energy surface. The transition path times depend on the properties both of the molecule and of the pulling device.},

abstract = {The regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins accelerate the intrinsic guanosine triphosphatase activity of heterotrimeric G-protein alpha subunits and are thus recognized as key modulators of G-protein-coupled receptor signaling. RGS12 and RGS14 contain not only the hallmark RGS box responsible for GTPase-accelerating activity but also a single G alpha(i/o)-Loco (GoLoco) motif predicted to represent a second G alpha interaction site. Here, we describe functional characterization of the GoLoco motif regions of RGS12 and RGS14. Both regions interact exclusively with G alpha(i1), G alpha(i2), and G alpha(i3) in their GDP-bound forms. In GTP gamma S binding assays, both regions exhibit guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) activity, inhibiting the rate of exchange of GDP for GTP by G alpha(i1). Both regions also stabilize G alpha(i1) in its GDP-bound form, inhibiting the increase in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence stimulated by AlF(4)(-). Our results indicate that both RGS12 and RGS14 harbor two distinctly different G alpha interaction sites: a previously recognized N-terminal RGS box possessing G alpha(i/o) GAP activity and a C-terminal GoLoco region exhibiting G alpha(i) GDI activity. The presence of two, independent G alpha interaction sites suggests that RGS12 and RGS14 participate in a complex coordination of G-protein signaling beyond simple G alpha GAP activity.},

abstract = {Luteinizing hormone stimulates testicular Leydig cells to produce testosterone by binding to a receptor that activates the G protein Gs and adenylyl cyclase. Testotoxicosis is a form of precocious puberty in which the Leydig cells secrete testosterone in the absence of luteinizing hormone, often due to constitutive activation of the luteinizing hormone receptor and (indirectly) Gs (refs 1-4). Here we study two unrelated boys suffering from a paradoxical combination of testotoxicosis and pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia (PHP-Ia), a condition marked by resistance to hormones acting through cyclic AMP (parathyroid hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone) as well as a 50% decrease in erythrocyte Gs activity (the remaining 50% is due to the normal Gs allele). In both patients, a mutation in the gene encoding the Gs alpha-subunit replace alanine at position 366 with serine. We show that this alpha s-A366S mutation constitutively activates adenylyl cyclase in vitro, causing hormone-independent cAMP accumulation when expressed in cultured cells, and accounting for the testotoxicosis phenotype (as cAMP stimulates testosterone secretion). Although alpha s-A366S is quite stable at testis temperature, it is rapidly degraded at 37 degrees C explaining the PHP-Ia phenotype caused by loss of Gs activity. In vitro experiments indicate that accelerated release of GDP causes both the constitutive activity and the thermolability of alpha s-A366S.},

The mechanisms by which they affect mammalian physiology remain poorly understood, but bacterial metabolites are likely to be key components of host interactions. Here we use bioinformatics and synthetic biology to mine the human microbiota for N-acyl amides that interact with G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). We found that N-acyl amide synthase genes are enriched in gastrointestinal bacteria and the lipids that they encode interact with GPCRs that regulate gastrointestinal tract physiology. Mouse and cell-based models demonstrate that commensal GPR119 agonists regulate metabolic hormones and glucose homeostasis as efficiently as human ligands, although future studies are needed to define their potential physiological role in humans. Our results suggest that chemical mimicry of eukaryotic signalling molecules may be common among commensal bacteria and that manipulation of microbiota genes encoding metabolites that elicit host cellular responses represents a possible small-molecule therapeutic modality (microbiome-biosynthetic gene therapy).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Efficient communication between distant sites within a protein is essential for cooperative biological response. Although often associated with large allosteric movements, more subtle changes in protein dynamics can also induce long-range correlations. However, an appropriate formalism that directly relates protein structural dynamics to information exchange between functional sites is still lacking.

RESULTS:Here we introduce a method to analyze protein dynamics within the framework of information theory and show that signal transduction within proteins can be considered as a particular instance of communication over a noisy channel. In particular, we analyze the conformational correlations between protein residues and apply the concept of mutual information to quantify information exchange. Mapping out changes of mutual information on the protein structure then allows visualizing how distal communication is achieved. We illustrate the approach by analyzing information transfer by the SH2 domain of Fyn tyrosine kinase, obtained from Monte Carlo dynamics simulations. Our analysis reveals that the Fyn SH2 domain forms a noisy communication channel that couples residues located in the phosphopeptide and specificity binding sites and a number of residues at the other side of the domain near the linkers that connect the SH2 domain to the SH3 and kinase domains. We find that for this particular domain, communication is affected by a series of contiguous residues that connect distal sites by crossing the core of the SH2 domain.

CONCLUSION:As a result, our method provides a means to directly map the exchange of biological information on the structure of protein domains, making it clear how binding triggers conformational changes in the protein structure. As such it provides a structural road, next to the existing attempts at sequence level, to predict long-range interactions within protein structures.},

abstract = {Unstructured proteins and peptides typically fold during binding to ligand proteins. A challenging problem is to identify the mechanism and kinetics of these binding-induced folding processes in experiments and atomistic simulations. In this Article, we present a detailed picture for the folding of the inhibitor peptide PMI into a helix during binding to the oncoprotein fragment25-109Mdm2 obtained from atomistic, explicit-water simulations and Markov state modeling. We find that binding-induced folding of PMI is highly parallel and can occur along a multitude of pathways. Some pathways are induced-fit-like with binding occurring prior to PMI helix formation, while other pathways are conformational-selection-like with binding after helix formation. On the majority of pathways, however, binding is intricately coupled to folding, without clear temporal ordering. A central feature of these pathways is PMI motion on the Mdm2 surface, along the binding groove of Mdm2 or over the rim of this groove. The native binding groove of Mdm2 thus appears as an asymmetric funnel for PMI binding. Overall, binding-induced folding of PMI does not fit into the classical picture of induced fit or conformational selection that implies a clear temporal ordering of binding and folding events. We argue that this holds in general for binding-induced folding processes because binding and folding events in these processes likely occur on similar time scales and do exhibit the time-scale separation required for temporal ordering.},

abstract = {Molecular recognition is determined by the structure and dynamics of both a protein and its ligand, but it is difficult to directly assess the role of each of these players. In this study, we use Markov State Models (MSMs) built from atomistic simulations to elucidate the mechanism by which the Lysine-, Arginine-, Ornithine-binding (LAO) protein binds to its ligand. We show that our model can predict the bound state, binding free energy, and association rate with reasonable accuracy and then use the model to dissect the binding mechanism. In the past, this binding event has often been assumed to occur via an induced fit mechanism because the protein's binding site is completely closed in the bound state, making it impossible for the ligand to enter the binding site after the protein has adopted the closed conformation. More complex mechanisms have also been hypothesized, but these have remained controversial. Here, we are able to directly observe roles for both the conformational selection and induced fit mechanisms in LAO binding. First, the LAO protein tends to form a partially closed encounter complex via conformational selection (that is, the apo protein can sample this state), though the induced fit mechanism can also play a role here. Then, interactions with the ligand can induce a transition to the bound state. Based on these results, we propose that MSMs built from atomistic simulations may be a powerful way of dissecting ligand-binding mechanisms and may eventually facilitate a deeper understanding of allostery as well as the prediction of new protein-ligand interactions, an important step in drug discovery.},

We construct an atomically-detailed model of G protein activation by combining three powerful computational methods; metadynamics, Markov state models (MSMs), and CARDS analysis of correlated motions. We uncover a mechanism that is consistent with a wide variety of structural and biochemical data. Surprisingly, the rate-limiting step for GDP release correlates with tilting rather than translation of the GPCR-binding helix 5. $\beta$-Strands 1-3 and helix 1 emerge as hubs in the allosteric network that links conformational changes in the GPCR-binding site to disordering of the distal nucleotide-binding site and consequent GDP release. Our approach and insights provide foundations for understanding disease-implicated G protein mutants, illuminating slow events in allosteric networks, and examining unbinding processes with slow off-rates.</p>},

abstract = {The ribose-binding protein (RBP) is a sugar-binding bacterial periplasmic protein whose function is associated with a large allosteric conformational change from an open to a closed conformation upon binding to ribose. The crystal structures of RBP in open and closed conformations have been solved. It has been hypothesized that the open and closed conformations exist in a dynamic equilibrium in solution, and that sugar binding shifts the population from open conformations to closed conformations. Here, we study by computer simulations the thermodynamic changes that accompany this conformational change, and model the structural changes that accompany the allosteric transition, using umbrella sampling molecular dynamics and the weighted histogram analysis method. The open state is comprised of a diverse ensemble of conformations; the open ribose-free X-ray crystal conformations being representative of this ensemble. The unligated open form of RBP is stabilized by conformational entropy. The simulations predict detectable populations of closed ribose-free conformations in solution. Additional interdomain hydrogen bonds stabilize this state. The predicted shift in equilibrium from the open to the closed state on binding to ribose is in agreement with experiments. This is driven by the energetic stabilization of the closed conformation due to ribose-protein interactions. We also observe a significant population of a hitherto unobserved ribose-bound partially open state. We believe that this state is the one that has been suggested to play a role in the transfer of ribose to the membrane-bound permease complex.},

abstract = {Ligand-induced protein allostery plays a central role in modulating cellular signalling pathways. Here using the conserved cyclic nucleotide-binding domain of protein kinase A's (PKA) regulatory subunit as a prototype signalling unit, we combine long-timescale, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with Markov state models to elucidate the conformational ensembles of PKA's cyclic nucleotide-binding domain A for the cAMP-free (apo) and cAMP-bound states. We find that both systems exhibit shallow free-energy landscapes that link functional states through multiple transition pathways. This observation suggests conformational selection as the general mechanism of allostery in this canonical signalling domain. Further, we expose the propagation of the allosteric signal through key structural motifs in the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain and explore the role of kinetics in its function. Our approach integrates disparate lines of experimental data into one cohesive framework to understand structure, dynamics and function in complex biological systems.},

As the film thickness is decreased, [Formula: see text] decreases rapidly and the average film dynamics are enhanced by 6-14 orders of magnitude. We show that the surface diffusion is invariant of the film thickness decrease and the resulting enhanced overall mobility. The values of the surface diffusion coefficient and its temperature dependence are invariant of film thickness and are the same as the corresponding bulk values ([Formula: see text]400 nm). For the thinnest films ([Formula: see text]20 nm), the effective activation energy for rearrangement (temperature dependence of relaxation times) becomes smaller than the activation energy for surface diffusion. These results suggest that the fast surface diffusion is decoupled from film relaxation dynamics and is a solely free surface property.},

To this end, we focus on a time-dependent version of scalar phi-four. We find closed form expressions for the resulting work distribution function, and we find that they are proper physical observables of the quantum field theory. Also, we show explicitly that the Jarzynski equality and Crooks fluctuation theorems hold at one-loop order independent of the renormalization scale. As a numerical case study, we compute the work distributions for an infinitely smooth protocol in the ultra-relativistic regime. In this case, it is found that work done through processes with pair creation is the dominant contribution.},

These simulations can benefit from adaptive boundaries that allow the high-resolution region to adapt (change size and/or shape) as the simulation progresses. The number of degrees of freedom required to accurately represent even a simple molecular process can vary by several orders of magnitude throughout the course of a simulation, and adaptive boundaries react to these changes to include an appropriate but not excessive amount of detail. Here, we derive the Hamiltonian and distribution function for such a molecular simulation. We also design an algorithm that can efficiently sample the boundary as a new coordinate of the system. We apply this framework to a mixed explicit/continuum simulation of a peptide in solvent. We use this example to discuss the conditions necessary for a successful implementation of adaptive boundaries that is both efficient and accurate in reproducing molecular properties.},

What is the best way to correct the whole MSM? For example, molecular dynamics simulations of protein folding may sample many microstates, possibly giving correct pathways through them while also giving the wrong overall folding rate when compared to experiment. Here, we describe Caliber Corrected Markov Modeling (C2M2), an approach based on the principle of maximum entropy for updating a Markov model by imposing state- and trajectory-based constraints. We show that such corrections are equivalent to asserting position-dependent diffusion coefficients in continuous-time continuous-space Markov processes modeled by a Smoluchowski equation. We derive the functional form of the diffusion coefficient explicitly in terms of the trajectory-based constraints. We illustrate with examples of 2D particle diffusion and an overdamped harmonic oscillator.},

Complementing experiments, computer simulations have provided detailed insights into the origins of the allostery by investigating the changes in structure, motion, and interactions upon dimerization, ligand and cofactor binding.

abstract = {Epistasis is a key factor in evolution since it determines which combinations of mutations provide adaptive solutions and which mutational pathways toward these solutions are accessible by natural selection. There is growing evidence for the pervasiveness of sign epistasis--a complete reversion of mutational effects, particularly in protein evolution--yet its molecular basis remains poorly understood. We describe the structural basis of sign epistasis between G238S and R164S, two adaptive mutations in TEM-1 $\beta$-lactamase--an enzyme that endows antibiotics resistance. Separated by 10 {\AA}, these mutations initiate two separate trajectories toward increased hydrolysis rates and resistance toward second and third-generation cephalosporins antibiotics. Both mutations allow the enzyme's active site to adopt alternative conformations and accommodate the new antibiotics. By solving the corresponding set of crystal structures, we found that R164S causes local disorder whereas G238S induces discrete conformations. When combined, the mutations in 238 and 164 induce local disorder whereby nonproductive conformations that perturb the enzyme's catalytic preorganization dominate. Specifically, Asn170 that coordinates the deacylating water molecule is misaligned, in both the free form and the inhibitor-bound double mutant. This local disorder is not restored by stabilizing global suppressor mutations and thus leads to an evolutionary cul-de-sac. Conformational dynamism therefore underlines the reshaping potential of protein's structures and functions but also limits protein evolvability because of the fragility of the interactions networks that maintain protein structures.},

abstract = {A network of coupled promoting motions in the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase is identified and characterized. The present identification is based on genomic analysis for sequence conservation, kinetic measurements of multiple mutations, and mixed quantum/classical molecular dynamics simulations of hydride transfer. The motions in this network span time scales of femtoseconds to milliseconds and are found on the exterior of the enzyme as well as in the active site. This type of network has broad implications for an expanded role of the protein fold in catalysis as well as ancillaries such as the engineering of altered protein function and the action of drugs distal to the active site.},

abstract = {Proteins with similar crystal structures can have dissimilar rates of substrate binding and catalysis. Here we used molecular dynamics simulations and biochemical analysis to determine the role of intradomain and interdomain motions in conferring distinct activation rates to two G$\alpha$ proteins, G$\alpha$(i1) and GPA1. Despite high structural similarity, GPA1 can activate itself without a receptor, whereas G$\alpha$(i1) cannot. We found that motions in these proteins vary greatly in type and frequency. Whereas motion is greatest in the Ras domain of G$\alpha$(i1), it is greatest in helices $\alpha$A and $\alpha$B from the helical domain of GPA1. Using protein chimeras, we show that helix $\alpha$A from GPA1 is sufficient to confer rapid activation to G$\alpha$(i1). G$\alpha$(i1) has less intradomain motion than GPA1 and instead displays interdomain displacement resembling that observed in a receptor-heterotrimer crystal complex. Thus, structurally similar proteins can have distinct atomic motions that confer distinct activation mechanisms.},

abstract = {The pathways by which small molecules (substrates or inhibitors) access active sites are a key aspect of the function of enzymes and other proteins. A key problem in designing or altering such proteins is to identify sites for mutation that will have the desired effect on the substrate transport properties. While specific access channels have been invoked in the past, molecular simulations suggest that multiple routes are possible, complicating the analysis. This complexity, however, can be captured by a Markov State Model (MSM) of the ligand diffusion process. We have developed a sensitivity analysis of the resulting rate matrix, which identifies the locations where mutations should have the largest effect on the diffusive on rate. We apply this method to myoglobin, which is the best characterized example both from experiment and simulation. We validate the approach by translating the sensitivity parameter obtained from this method into the CO binding rates in myoglobin upon mutation, resulting in a semi-quantitative correlation with experiments. The model is further validated against an explicit simulation for one of the experimental mutants. },

G(alpha)(o) and G(alpha)(i1) display a 5-fold difference in the rate of GDP dissociation with half-times of 2.3 +/- 0.2 and 10.4 +/- 1.3 min, respectively. To identify molecular determinants of the GDP release rate, we evaluated the rate of binding of the fluorescent guanine nucleotide 2'(3')-O-(N-methyl-3'-anthraniloyl)guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (mGTPgammaS) to chimers of G(alpha)(o) and G(alpha)(i1). Although no one region of the G protein determined the GDP dissociation rate, when the C-terminal 123 amino acids in G(alpha)(i1) were replaced with those of G(alpha)(o), the GDP release rate increased 3.3-fold compared to that of wild-type G(alpha)(i1). Within the C-terminal portion, modification of four amino acids in a coil between beta4 and the alpha3 helix resulted in GDP release kinetics identical to those of wild-type G(alpha)(o). Based on the G(alpha)(i1)-GDP crystal structure of this region, Leu(232) appeared to form a hydrophobic contact with Arg(144) of the helical domain. The role of this interaction was confirmed by G(alpha)(i1) L232Q and G(alpha)(i1) R144A which displayed 2-5-fold faster GDP release rates compared to wild-type G(alpha)(i1) (t(1/2) 4.7 and 1.5 min, respectively), suggesting that interdomain bridging contacts partially determine the basal rate of GDP release from heterotrimeric G proteins.},

abstract = {Enhanced sampling techniques that target a set of collective variables and that use molecular dynamics as the driving engine have seen widespread application in the computational molecular sciences as a means to explore the free-energy landscapes of complex systems. The use of molecular dynamics as the fundamental driver of the sampling requires the introduction of a time step whose magnitude is limited by the fastest motions in a system. While standard multiple time-stepping methods allow larger time steps to be employed for the slower and computationally more expensive forces, the maximum achievable increase in time step is limited by resonance phenomena, which inextricably couple fast and slow motions. Recently, we introduced deterministic and stochastic resonance-free multiple time step algorithms for molecular dynamics that solve this resonance problem and allow ten- to twenty-fold gains in the large time step compared to standard multiple time step algorithms [P. Minary et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 150201 (2004); B. Leimkuhler et al., Mol. Phys. 111, 3579-3594 (2013)]. These methods are based on the imposition of isokinetic constraints that couple the physical system to Nos{\'e}-Hoover chains or Nos{\'e}-Hoover Langevin schemes. In this paper, we show how to adapt these methods for collective variable-based enhanced sampling techniques, specifically adiabatic free-energy dynamics/temperature-accelerated molecular dynamics, unified free-energy dynamics, and by extension, metadynamics, thus allowing simulations employing these methods to employ similarly very large time steps. The combination of resonance-free multiple time step integrators with free-energy-based enhanced sampling significantly improves the efficiency of conformational exploration.},

To define the core GPR motif and key amino acid residues within a GPR peptide (TMGEEDFFDLLAKSQSKRMDDQRVDLAG), we determined the effect of truncation, insertion, and alanine substitutions on peptide-mediated inhibition of GTPgammaS binding to purified Galpha(i1). The bioactive core GPR peptide consists of 17 amino acids ((7)F-R(23)). Within this core motif, two hydrophobic sectors ((7)FF(8) and (10)LL(11)) and Q(22) are required for bioactivity, whereas M19A and R23A increased IC(50) values by 70-fold. Disruption of spatial relationships between the required sectors in the amino and carboxyl regions of the peptide also resulted in a loss of biological activity. Mutation of three charged sectors ((4)EED(6), R(18), (20)DD(21)) within the 28-amino acid GPR decreased peptide affinity by approximately 10-fold. Alanine substitutions of selected residues within the core GPR peptide differently influenced peptide inhibition of GTPgammaS binding to Galpha(i) versus Galpha(o). These data provide a platform for the development of novel, G-protein-selective therapeutics that inhibit Galpha(i)- mediated signaling, selectively activate Gbetagamma-sensitive effectors, and/or disrupt specific regulatory input to G-proteins mediated by GPR-containing proteins.},

Here we reveal the existence of a selectivity barcode (that is, patterns of amino acids) on each of the 16 human G proteins that is recognized by distinct regions on the approximately 800 human receptors. Although universally conserved positions in the barcode allow the receptors to bind and activate G proteins in a similar manner, different receptors recognize the unique positions of the G-protein barcode through distinct residues, like multiple keys (receptors) opening the same lock (G protein) using non-identical cuts. Considering the evolutionary history of GPCRs allows the identification of these selectivity-determining residues. These findings lay the foundation for understanding the molecular basis of coupling selectivity within individual receptors and G proteins.},

abstract = {Accurately predicting protein-ligand binding affinities and binding modes is a major goal in computational chemistry, but even the prediction of ligand binding modes in proteins poses major challenges. Here, we focus on solving the binding mode prediction problem for rigid fragments. That is, we focus on computing the dominant placement, conformation, and orientations of a relatively rigid, fragment-like ligand in a receptor, and the populations of the multiple binding modes which may be relevant. This problem is important in its own right, but is even more timely given the recent success of alchemical free energy calculations. Alchemical calculations are increasingly used to predict binding free energies of ligands to receptors. However, the accuracy of these calculations is dependent on proper sampling of the relevant ligand binding modes. Unfortunately, ligand binding modes may often be uncertain, hard to predict, and/or slow to interconvert on simulation time scales, so proper sampling with current techniques can require prohibitively long simulations. We need new methods which dramatically improve sampling of ligand binding modes. Here, we develop and apply a nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) method to improve sampling of ligand binding modes. In this technique, the ligand is rotated and subsequently allowed to relax in its new position through alchemical perturbation before accepting or rejecting the rotation and relaxation as a nonequilibrium Monte Carlo move. When applied to a T4 lysozyme model binding system, this NCMC method shows over 2 orders of magnitude improvement in binding mode sampling efficiency compared to a brute force molecular dynamics simulation. This is a first step toward applying this methodology to pharmaceutically relevant binding of fragments and, eventually, drug-like molecules. We are making this approach available via our new Binding modes of ligands using enhanced sampling (BLUES) package which is freely available on GitHub.},

abstract = {A number of structural factors modulate the activity of Abelson (Abl) tyrosine kinase, whose deregulation is often related to oncogenic processes. First, only the open conformation of the Abl kinase domain's activation loop (A-loop) favors ATP binding to the catalytic cleft. In this regard, the trans-autophosphorylation of the Y412 residue, which is located along the A-loop, favors the stability of the open conformation, in turn enhancing Abl activity. Another key factor for full Abl activity is the formation of active conformations of the catalytic DFG motif in the Abl kinase domain. Furthermore, binding of the SH2 domain to the N-lobe of the Abl kinase domain was recently demonstrated to have a long-range allosteric effect on the stabilization of the A-loop open state. Intriguingly, these distinct structural factors imply a complex signal transmission network for controlling the A-loop's flexibility and conformational preference for optimal Abl function. However, the exact dynamical features of this signal transmission network structure remain unclear. Here, we report on microsecond-long molecular dynamics coupled with enhanced sampling simulations of multiple Abl model systems, in the presence or absence of the SH2 domain, and with the DFG motif flipped in two ways (in or out conformation). Through comparative analysis, our simulations augment the interpretation of the existing Abl experimental data, revealing a dynamical network of interactions that interconnect SH2 domain-binding with A-loop plasticity and Y412 autophosphorylation in Abl. This signaling network engages the DFG motif and, importantly, other conserved structural elements of the kinase domain, namely the EPK-ELK H-bond network and the HRD motif. Our results show that the signal propagation for modulating the A-loop spatial localization is highly dependent on the HRD motif conformation, which thus acts as the central hub of this (allosteric) signaling network controlling Abl activation and function.},

The aim of this method is to provide an analysis of conformations of biopolymers from the contact viewpoint. It may assist a systematical uncovering of conformational switching mechanisms existing in proteins and biopolymer systems in general by statistical analysis of simulation snapshots. In contrast to conventional correlation analyses of Cartesian coordinates (such as distance covariance analysis and Cartesian principal component analysis), this program also provides an alternative way to locate essential collective motions in general.

abstract = {Accurate protein structure in the ligand-bound state is a prerequisite for successful structure-based virtual screening (SBVS). Therefore, applications of SBVS against targets for which only an apo structure is available may be severely limited. To address this constraint, we developed a computational strategy to explore the ligand-bound state of a target protein, by combined use of molecular dynamics simulation, MM/GBSA binding energy calculation, and fragment-centric topographical mapping. Our computational strategy is validated against low-molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMW-PTP) and then successfully employed in the SBVS against protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO), a potential therapeutic target for various diseases. The most potent hit compound GP03 showed an IC50 value of 2.89 $\mu$M for PTPRO and possessed a certain degree of selectivity toward other protein phosphatases. Importantly, we also found that neglecting the ligand energy penalty upon binding partially accounts for the false positive SBVS hits. The preliminary structure-activity relationships of GP03 analogs are also reported.},

abstract = {Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a neurohormone that maintains circadian rhythms1 by synchronization to environmental cues and is involved in diverse physiological processes2 such as the regulation of blood pressure and core body temperature, oncogenesis, and immune function3. Melatonin is formed in the pineal gland in a light-regulated manner4 by enzymatic conversion from 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT or serotonin), and modulates sleep and wakefulness5 by activating two high-affinity G-protein-coupled receptors, type 1A (MT1) and type 1B (MT2)3,6. Shift work, travel, and ubiquitous artificial lighting can disrupt natural circadian rhythms; as a result, sleep disorders affect a substantial population in modern society and pose a considerable economic burden7. Over-the-counter melatonin is widely used to alleviate jet lag and as a safer alternative to benzodiazepines and other sleeping aids8,9, and is one of the most popular supplements in the United States10. Here, we present high-resolution room-temperature X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) structures of MT1 in complex with four agonists: the insomnia drug ramelteon11, two melatonin analogues, and the mixed melatonin-serotonin antidepressant agomelatine12,13. The structure of MT2 is described in an accompanying paper14. Although the MT1 and 5-HT receptors have similar endogenous ligands, and agomelatine acts on both receptors, the receptors differ markedly in the structure and composition of their ligand pockets; in MT1, access to the ligand pocket is tightly sealed from solvent by extracellular loop 2, leaving only a narrow channel between transmembrane helices IV and V that connects it to the lipid bilayer. The binding site is extremely compact, and ligands interact with MT1 mainly by strong aromatic stacking with Phe179 and auxiliary hydrogen bonds with Asn162 and Gln181. Our structures provide an unexpected example of atypical ligand entry for a non-lipid receptor, lay the molecular foundation of ligand recognition by melatonin receptors, and will facilitate the design of future tool compounds and therapeutic agents, while their comparison to 5-HT receptors yields insights into the evolution and polypharmacology of G-protein-coupled receptors.},

abstract = {A goal in the kinetic characterization of a macromolecular system is the description of its slow relaxation processes, involving (i) identification of the structural changes involved in these processes, and (ii) estimation of the rates or timescales at which these slow processes occur. Most of the approaches to this task, including Markov models, Master-equation models, and kinetic network models, start by discretizing the high-dimensional state space and then characterize relaxation processes in terms of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a discrete transition matrix. The practical success of such an approach depends very much on the ability to finely discretize the slow order parameters. How can this task be achieved in a high-dimensional configuration space without relying on subjective guesses of the slow order parameters? In this paper, we use the variational principle of conformation dynamics to derive an optimal way of identifying the "slow subspace" of a large set of prior order parameters - either generic internal coordinates (distances and dihedral angles), or a user-defined set of parameters. It is shown that a method to identify this slow subspace exists in statistics: the time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA). Furthermore, optimal indicators-order parameters indicating the progress of the slow transitions and thus may serve as reaction coordinates-are readily identified. We demonstrate that the slow subspace is well suited to construct accurate kinetic models of two sets of molecular dynamics simulations, the 6-residue fluorescent peptide MR121-GSGSW and the 30-residue natively disordered peptide KID. The identified optimal indicators reveal the structural changes associated with the slow processes of the molecular system under analysis.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:Glucocorticoids (GCs) are used to improve respiratory mechanics in preterm infants despite clinical evidence linking neonatal GC therapy to cerebellar pathology. In developing mouse cerebellum, the GC dexamethasone (DEX) causes rapid GC-induced neural progenitor cell apoptosis (GINA). Focusing on pharmacological neuroprotection strategies, we investigated whether dexmedetomidine (DMT) protects against GINA.

METHODS:Neonatal mice were pretreated with DMT prior to DEX challenge. Additionally, we tested clonidine and yohimbine in vivo to determine mechanism of DMT neuroprotection. For in vitro studies, cerebellar neural progenitor cells were pretreated with DMT before DEX challenge.

RESULTS:In vivo, DMT attenuated GINA at 1 $\mu$g/kg and above, p < 0.0001. Clonidine significantly attenuated GINA, p < 0.0001, while yohimbine reversed DMT neuroprotection, p < 0.0001, suggesting DMT neuroprotection is likely mediated via adrenergic signaling. In vitro, DMT neuroprotection was achieved at 10 $\mu$M and above, p < 0.001, indicating DMT rescue is cell autonomous.

CONCLUSIONS:DMT affords dose-dependent neuroprotection from GINA at clinically relevant doses, an effect that is cell autonomous and likely mediated by $\alpha$2 adrenergic receptor agonism. DMT co-administration with GCs may be an effective strategy to protect the neonatal brain from GINA while retaining the beneficial effects of GCs on respiratory mechanics.},

abstract = {The dynamic events that underlie the nucleotide exchange process for the Galpha subunit of transducin (Galpha(t)) were studied with nanosecond time-scale molecular dynamics simulations. The modeled systems include the active and inactive forms of the wild-type Galpha(t) and three of its mutants (GDP-bound form only): F332A, A322S, and Q326A that are known to exhibit various degrees of enhancement of their basal and receptor-catalyzed rates of nucleotide exchange (150-fold, 70-fold and WT-like, respectively). The results of these computational experiments reveal a number of nucleotide-dependent structural and dynamic changes (involving the alpha(B)-alpha(C) loop, the inter-domain orientation of the helical and GTPase domains and the alpha(5) helix) that were not observed in the various crystal structures of Galpha(t). Notably, the results show the existence of a front to back communication device (involving the beta(2)-beta(3) hairpin, the alpha(1) helix and the alpha(5) helix), strategically located near all elements susceptible to be involved in receptor-mediated activation/nucleotide exchange. The wild-type simulations suggest that the dynamic interplay between the elements of this device would be critical for the activation of the Galpha(t) subunit. This inference is confirmed by the results of the computational experiments on the mutants that show that even in their GDP-bound forms, the A322S and F332A mutants acquire an "active-like" structure and dynamics phenotype. The same is not true for the Q326A mutant whose structural and dynamic properties remain similar to those of the GDP-bound WT. Taken together the results suggest a nucleotide exchange mechanism, analogous to that found in the Arf family GTPases, in which a partially activated state, achievable from a receptor-mediated action of the front to back communication device either by displacement of the C-terminal alpha(5) helix, of the N-terminal alpha(N) helix, or of the Gbetagamma subunit, could precede the dissociation of GDP from the native Galpha subunit.},

abstract = {Accurate force fields are essential for reproducing the conformational and dynamic behavior of condensed-phase systems. The popular AMBER force field has parameters for monophosphates, but they do not extend well to polyphorylated molecules such as ADP and ATP. This work presents parameters for the partial charges, atom types, bond angles, and torsions in simple polyphosphorylated compounds. The parameters are based on molecular orbital calculations of methyldiphosphate and methyltriphosphate at the RHF/6-31+G* level. The new parameters were fit to the entire potential energy surface (not just minima) with an RMSD of 0.62 kcal/mol. This is exceptional agreement and a significant improvement over the current parameters that produce a potential surface with an RMSD of 7.8 kcal/mol to that of the ab initio calculations. Testing has shown that the parameters are transferable and capable of reproducing the gas-phase conformations of inorganic diphosphate and triphosphate. Also, the parameters are an improvement over existing parameters in the condensed phase as shown by minimizations of ATP bound in several proteins. These parameters are intended for use with the existing AMBER 94/99 force field, and they will permit users to apply AMBER to a wider variety of important enzymatic systems.},

abstract = {Biochemical activity and core stability are essential properties of proteins, maintained usually by conserved amino acids. Structural dynamics emerged in recent years as another essential aspect of protein functionality. Structural dynamics enable the adaptation of the protein to binding substrates and to undergo allosteric transitions, while maintaining the native fold. Key residues that mediate structural dynamics would thus be expected to be conserved or exhibit coevolutionary patterns at least. Yet, the correlation between sequence evolution and structural dynamics is yet to be established. With recent advances in efficient characterization of structural dynamics, we are now in a position to perform a systematic analysis. In the present study, a set of 34 enzymes representing various folds and functional classes is analyzed using information theory and elastic network models. Our analysis shows that the structural regions distinguished by their coevolution propensity as well as high mobility are predisposed to serve as substrate recognition sites, whereas residues acting as global hinges during collective dynamics are often supported by conserved residues. We propose a mobility scale for different types of amino acids, which tends to vary inversely with amino acid conservation. Our findings suggest the balance between physical adaptability (enabled by structure-encoded motions) and chemical specificity (conferred by correlated amino acid substitutions) underlies the selection of a relatively small set of versatile folds by proteins.},

It distinguishes between thermally averaged promoting motions that influence the activation free energy barrier and dynamical motions that influence the barrier recrossings. Applications to hydride transfer in liver alcohol dehydrogenase and dihydrofolate reductase resulted in the identification and characterization of important enzyme motions.

We find that the long-time dynamics of such systems are biased toward states that exhibit a fine-tuned extremization of environmental forcing.},

However, the structural mechanism of the accelerated GDP dissociation has remained unclear.

We show that G$\alpha$ rapidly exchanges between a ground-state conformation, which tightly binds to GDP and an excited conformation with reduced GDP affinity.

In this work we demonstrate how a recently introduced metadynamics-based approach allows exploration of the unbinding pathways, estimation of the rates, and determination of the rate-limiting steps in the paradigmatic case of the trypsin-benzamidine system. Protein, ligand, and solvent are described with full atomic resolution. Using metadynamics, multiple unbinding trajectories that start with the ligand in the crystallographic binding pose and end with the ligand in the fully solvated state are generated. The unbinding rate k off is computed from the mean residence time of the ligand. Using our previously computed binding affinity we also obtain the binding rate k on. Both rates are in agreement with reported experimental values. We uncover the complex pathways of unbinding trajectories and describe the critical rate-limiting steps with unprecedented detail. Our findings illuminate the role played by the coupling between subtle protein backbone fluctuations and the solvation by water molecules that enter the binding pocket and assist in the breaking of the shielded hydrogen bonds. We expect our approach to be useful in calculating rates for general protein-ligand systems and a valid support for drug design.},

This approximation is difficult to make for high-dimensional biomolecular systems, and the quality and reproducibility of MSMs has, therefore, been limited. Here, we discard the assumption that dynamics are Markovian on the discrete clusters. Instead, we only assume that the full phase-space molecular dynamics is Markovian, and a projection of this full dynamics is observed on the discrete states, leading to the concept of Projected Markov Models (PMMs). Robust estimation methods for PMMs are not yet available, but we derive a practically feasible approximation via Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). It is shown how various mol...},

abstract = {Molecular recognition is determined by the structure and dynamics of both a protein and its ligand, but it is difficult to directly assess the role of each of these players. In this study, we use Markov State Models (MSMs) built from atomistic simulations to elucidate the mechanism by which the Lysine-, Arginine-, Ornithine-binding (LAO) protein binds to its ligand. We show that our model can predict the bound state, binding free energy, and association rate with reasonable accuracy and then use the model to dissect the binding mechanism. In the past, this binding event has often been assumed to occur via an induced fit mechanism because the protein's binding site is completely closed in the bound state, making it impossible for the ligand to enter the binding site after the protein has adopted the closed conformation. More complex mechanisms have also been hypothesized, but these have remained controversial. Here, we are able to directly observe roles for both the conformational selection and induced fit mechanisms in LAO binding. First, the LAO protein tends to form a partially closed encounter complex via conformational selection (that is, the apo protein can sample this state), though the induced fit mechanism can also play a role here. Then, interactions with the ligand can induce a transition to the bound state. Based on these results, we propose that MSMs built from atomistic simulations may be a powerful way of dissecting ligand-binding mechanisms and may eventually facilitate a deeper understanding of allostery as well as the prediction of new protein-ligand interactions, an important step in drug discovery.},

abstract = {Following the discovery that the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is the source of $\beta$-amyloid peptides (A$\beta$) that accumulate in Alzheimer's disease (AD), structural analyses suggested that the holoprotein resembles a transmembrane receptor. Initial studies using reconstituted membranes demonstrated that APP can directly interact with the heterotrimeric G protein G$\alpha$o (but not other G proteins) via an evolutionarily G protein-binding motif in its cytoplasmic domain. Subsequent investigations in cell culture showed that antibodies against the extracellular domain of APP could stimulate G$\alpha$o activity, presumably mimicking endogenous APP ligands. In addition, chronically activating wild type APP or overexpressing mutant APP isoforms linked with familial AD could provoke Go-dependent neurotoxic responses, while biochemical assays using human brain samples suggested that the endogenous APP-Go interactions are perturbed in AD patients. More recently, several G protein-dependent pathways have been implicated in the physiological roles of APP, coupled with evidence that APP interacts both physically and functionally with G$\alpha$o in a variety of contexts. Work in insect models has demonstrated that the APP ortholog APPL directly interacts with G$\alpha$o in motile neurons, whereby APPL-G$\alpha$o signaling regulates the response of migratory neurons to ligands encountered in the developing nervous system. Concurrent studies using cultured mammalian neurons and organotypic hippocampal slice preparations have shown that APP signaling transduces the neuroprotective effects of soluble sAPP$\alpha$ fragments via modulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, providing a mechanism for integrating the stress and survival responses regulated by APP. Notably, this effect was also inhibited by pertussis toxin, indicating an essential role for G$\alpha$o/i proteins. Unexpectedly, C-terminal fragments (CTFs) derived from APP have also been found to interact with G$\alpha$s, whereby CTF-G$\alpha$s signaling can promote neurite outgrowth via adenylyl cyclase/PKA-dependent pathways. These reports offer the intriguing perspective that G protein switching might modulate APP-dependent responses in a context-dependent manner. In this review, we provide an up-to-date perspective on the model that APP plays a variety of roles as an atypical G protein-coupled receptor in both the developing and adult nervous system, and we discuss the hypothesis that disruption of these normal functions might contribute to the progressive neuropathologies that typify AD.},

abstract = {Cooperative interactions link the behavior of different amino acid residues within a protein molecule. As a result, the effects of chemical or physical perturbations to any given residue are propagated to other residues by an intricate network of interactions. Very often, amino acids "sense" the effects of perturbations occurring at very distant locations in the protein molecule. In these studies, we have investigated by computer simulation the structural distribution of those interactions. We show here that cooperative interactions are not intrinsically bi-directional and that different residues play different roles within the intricate network of interactions existing in a protein. The effect of a perturbation to residue j on residue k is not necessarily equal to the effect of the same perturbation to residue k on residue j. In this paper, we introduce a computer algorithm aimed at mapping the network of cooperative interactions within a protein. This algorithm exhaustively performs single site thermodynamic mutations to each residue in the protein and examines the effects of those mutations on the distribution of conformational states. The algorithm has been applied to three different proteins (lambda repressor fragment 6-85, chymotrypsin inhibitor 2, and barnase). This algorithm accounts well for the observed behavior of these proteins.},

abstract = {Exactly 50 years ago, biochemists raised the question of the mechanism of the conformational change that mediates "allosteric" interactions between regulatory sites and biologically active sites in regulatory/receptor proteins. Do the different conformations involved already exist spontaneously in the absence of the regulatory ligands (Monod-Wyman-Changeux), such that the complementary protein conformation would be selected to mediate signal transduction, or do particular ligands induce the receptor to adopt the conformation best suited to them (Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer-induced fit)? This is not just a central question for biophysics, it also has enormous importance for drug design. Recent advances in techniques have allowed detailed experimental and theoretical comparisons with the formal models of both scenarios. Also, it has been shown that mutated receptors can adopt constitutively active confirmations in the absence of ligand. There have also been demonstrations that the atomic resolution structures of the same protein are essentially the same whether ligand is bound or not. These and other advances in past decades have produced a situation where the vast majority of the data using different categories of regulatory proteins (including regulatory enzymes, ligand-gated ion channels, G protein-coupled receptors, and nuclear receptors) support the conformational selection scheme of signal transduction.},

abstract = {Heterotrimeric G proteins are activated by exchange of GDP for GTP at the G protein alpha subunit (G$\alpha$), most notably by G protein-coupled transmembrane receptors. Ric-8A is a soluble cytoplasmic protein essential for embryonic development that acts as both a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and a chaperone for G$\alpha$ subunits of the i, q, and 12/13 classes. Previous studies demonstrated that Ric-8A stabilizes a dynamically disordered state of nucleotide-free G$\alpha$ as the catalytic intermediate for nucleotide exchange, but no information was obtained on the structures involved or the magnitude of the structural fluctuations. In the present study, site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) together with double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy is used to provide global distance constraints that identify discrete members of a conformational ensemble in the G$\alpha$i1:Ric-8A complex and the magnitude of structural differences between them. In the complex, the helical and Ras-like nucleotide-binding domains of G$\alpha$i1 pivot apart to occupy multiple resolved states with displacements as large as 25 {\AA}. The domain displacement appears to be distinct from that observed in G$\alpha$s upon binding of Gs to the $\beta$2 adrenergic receptor. Moreover, the Ras-like domain exhibits structural plasticity within and around the nucleotide-binding cavity, and the switch I and switch II regions, which are known to adopt different conformations in the GDP- and GTP-bound states of G$\alpha$, undergo structural rearrangements. Collectively, the data show that Ric-8A induces a conformationally heterogeneous state of G$\alpha$i and provide insight into the mechanism of action of a nonreceptor G$\alpha$ GEF.},

abstract = {Receptor-promoted GTP binding and GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-promoted GTP hydrolysis determine the onset and termination of G protein signaling; they coordinately control signal amplitude. The mechanisms whereby cells independently regulate signal kinetics and signal amplitude are therefore central to understanding G protein function. We have used quench-flow kinetic methods to measure the rates of the individual reactions of the agonist-stimulated GTPase cycle for G(q) during steady-state signaling. G(q) and m1 muscarinic cholinergic receptor were co-reconstituted into proteoliposomes with one of two GAPs: phospholipase C (PLC)-beta1, the major G(q)-regulated effector protein, and RGS4, a GAP commonly thought to be an inhibitor of G(q) signaling. In this system, the rate constant for GAP-stimulated hydrolysis of Galpha(q)-bound GTP at 30 degrees C was 9-12 s(-1) for PLC-beta1 and 22-27 s(-1) for RGS4. These rates are 1,000- to 2,000-fold faster than in the absence of a GAP and far faster than measured previously. G(q) can thus hydrolyze bound GTP with deactivation half-times of 25-75 ms at 30 degrees C, commensurate with physiological rates of signal termination. GDP/GTP exchange, which reactivates G(q), was the principal rate-limiting step for the GTPase cycle and was also faster than previously thought. At physiological concentrations of GTP, exchange was limited by the rate of dissociation of GDP from the receptor-G(q) complex, with a maximal rate of 1.8 s(-1) at 30 degrees C. Comparison of activation and deactivation rates help explain how GDP/GTP exchange balance rapid GTP hydrolysis to maintain steady-state signal amplitude.},

abstract = {Adaptive sampling methods, often used in combination with Markov state models, are becoming increasingly popular for speeding up rare events in simulation such as molecular dynamics (MD) without biasing the system dynamics. Several adaptive sampling strategies have been proposed, but it is not clear which methods perform better for different physical systems. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of selected adaptive sampling strategies on a wide selection of fast folding proteins. The adaptive sampling strategies were emulated using models constructed on already existing MD trajectories. We provide theoretical limits for the sampling speed-up and compare the performance of different strategies with and without using some a priori knowledge of the system. The results show that for different goals, different adaptive sampling strategies are optimal. In order to sample slow dynamical processes such as protein folding without a priori knowledge of the system, a strategy based on the identification of a set of metastable regions is consistently the most efficient, while a strategy based on the identification of microstates performs better if the goal is to explore newer regions of the conformational space. Interestingly, the maximum speed-up achievable for the adaptive sampling of slow processes increases for proteins with longer folding times, encouraging the application of these methods for the characterization of slower processes, beyond the fast-folding proteins considered here.},

abstract = {Proteins display a hierarchy of structural features at primary, secondary, tertiary, and higher-order levels, an organization that guides our current understanding of their biological properties and evolutionary origins. Here, we reveal a structural organization distinct from this traditional hierarchy by statistical analysis of correlated evolution between amino acids. Applied to the S1A serine proteases, the analysis indicates a decomposition of the protein into three quasi-independent groups of correlated amino acids that we term "protein sectors." Each sector is physically connected in the tertiary structure, has a distinct functional role, and constitutes an independent mode of sequence divergence in the protein family. Functionally relevant sectors are evident in other protein families as well, suggesting that they may be general features of proteins. We propose that sectors represent a structural organization of proteins that reflects their evolutionary histories.},

abstract = {Silica is one of the most abundant minerals on Earth and is widely used in many fields. Investigating the crystallization of liquid silica by atomic simulations is of great importance to understand the crystallization mechanism; however, the high crystallization barrier and the tendency of silica to form glasses make such simulations very challenging. Here we have studied liquid silica crystallization to $\beta$-cristobalite with metadynamics, using X-ray diffraction (XRD) peak intensities as collective variables. The frequent transitions between solid and liquid of the biased runs demonstrate the highly successful use of the XRD peak intensities as collective variables, which leads to the convergence of the free-energy surface. By calculating the difference in free energy, we have estimated the melting temperature of $\beta$-cristobalite, which is in good agreement with the literature. The nucleation mechanism during the crystallization of liquid silica can be described by classical nucleation theory.},

abstract = {The prokaryotic global transcription factor CRP has been considered to be an ideal model for in-depth study of both the allostery of the protein and the differential utilization of the homologous cyclic nucleotide second messengers cAMP and cGMP. Here, atomic details from the crystal structures of two inactive CRP species, an apo form and a cGMP-bound form, in comparison with a known active conformation, the cAMP-CRP complex, provide macroscopic and microscopic insights into CRP allostery, which is coupled to specific discrimination between the two effectors. The cAMP-induced conformational transition, including dynamic fluctuations, can be driven by the fundamental folding forces that cause water-soluble globular proteins to construct an optimized hydrophobic core, including secondary-structure formation. The observed conformational asymmetries underlie a negative cooperativity in the sequential binding of cyclic nucleotides and a stepwise manner of binding with discrimination between the effector molecules. Additionally, the finding that cGMP, which is specifically recognized in a syn conformation, induces an inhibitory conformational change, rather than a null effect, on CRP supports the intriguing possibility that cGMP signalling could be widely utilized in prokaryotes, including in aggressive inhibition of CRP-like proteins.},

abstract = {The heterotrimeric G proteins transduce extracellular signals by interacting with specific intracellular effectors. We have used a scanning mutagenesis approach to identify amino acids of alpha S, the alpha subunit of Gs, that determine the specificity of its interaction with its effector, adenylyl cyclase. In alpha subunit chimeras, residues 236-356 of alpha S comprise the shortest linear stretch that is required for activation of adenylyl cyclase. Within these 121 residues, we identified four clusters of residues in which substitutions prevented effector activation. Mutations in three of these regions did not affect alpha subunit expression or the GTP-induced conformational change. The identified alpha S residues in the NH2-terminal half of the 121-residue region endowed the cognate alpha i2 segment with the ability to activate effector, while those in the COOH-terminal half did not. In a three-dimensional G alpha model, based on the structure of p21ras, the effector-activating residues of alpha S form a surface on the membrane-facing side of the molecule; this surface includes a region that changes conformation upon binding GTP.},

abstract = {Direct targeting of intracellular G$\alpha$ subunits of G protein-coupled receptors by chemical tools represents a challenging task in both, current pharmacological studies and developing novel therapeutic approaches. Here we analyzed novel FR900359-based analogs from natural sources, synthetic cyclic peptides as well as all so-far known G$\alpha$q inhibitors in a comprehensive study to devise a strategy for the elucidation of characteristics that determine interaction with and inhibition of Gq in the specific FR/YM binding pocket. Using 2D NMR spectroscopy and molecular docking we have identified unique features in the macrocyclic structures responsible for binding to the target protein correlating with inhibitory activity. While all novel compounds were devoid of effects on Gi and Gs proteins, no inhibitor surpassed biological activity of FR. This raises the question of whether depsipeptides such as FR already represent valuable chemical tools for specific inhibition of Gq and, at the same time, are suitable natural lead structures for the development of novel compounds to target G$\alpha$ subunits other than Gq.},

Several recent Markovian approaches use "extended reservoirs"-explicit degrees of freedom associated with the electrodes-distinguishing them from many previous classes of master equations. Starting from a Lindblad equation, we develop a common foundation for these approaches. Due to the incorporation of explicit electrode states, these methods do not require a large bias or even "true Markovianity" of the reservoirs. Nonetheless, their predictions are only physically relevant when the Markovian relaxation is weaker than the thermal broadening and when the extended reservoirs are "sufficiently large," in a sense that we quantify. These considerations hold despite complete positivity and respect for Pauli exclusion at any relaxation strength.},

abstract = {The functional cycle of many proteins involves large-scale motions of domains and subunits. The relation between conformational dynamics and the chemical steps of enzymes remains under debate. Here we show that in the presence of substrates, domain motions of an enzyme can take place on the microsecond time scale, yet exert influence on the much-slower chemical step. We study the domain closure reaction of the enzyme adenylate kinase fromEscherichia coliwhile in action (i.e., under turnover conditions), using single-molecule FRET spectroscopy. We find that substrate binding increases dramatically domain closing and opening times, making them as short as ∼15 and ∼45 {\textmu}s, respectively. These large-scale conformational dynamics are likely the fastest measured to date, and are ∼100-200 times faster than the enzymatic turnover rate. Some active-site mutants are shown to fully or partially prevent the substrate-induced increase in domain closure times, while at the same time they also reduce enzymatic activity, establishing a clear connection between the two phenomena, despite their disparate time scales. Based on these surprising observations, we propose a paradigm for the mode of action of enzymes, in which numerous cycles of conformational rearrangement are required to find a mutual orientation of substrates that is optimal for the chemical reaction.},

The strategy relies on mimicry of protein motifs that exhibit a concentration of native hot spot residues. To address this constraint, we present a pocket-centric computational design strategy guided by AlphaSpace to identify high-quality pockets near the peptidomimetic motif that are both targetable and unoccupied. Alpha-clusters serve as a spatial representation of pocket space and are used to guide the selection of natural and non-natural amino acid mutations to design inhibitors that optimize pocket occupation across the interface. We tested the strategy against a challenging protein-protein interaction target, KIX/MLL, by optimizing a single helical motif within MLL to compete against the full-length wild-type MLL sequence. Molecular dynamics simulation and experimental fluorescence polarization assays are used to verify the efficacy of the optimized peptide sequence.},

abstract = {Proteins display a hierarchy of structural features at primary, secondary, tertiary, and higher-order levels, an organization that guides our current understanding of their biological properties and evolutionary origins. Here, we reveal a structural organization distinct from this traditional hierarchy by statistical analysis of correlated evolution between amino acids. Applied to the S1A serine proteases, the analysis indicates a decomposition of the protein into three quasi-independent groups of correlated amino acids that we term "protein sectors." Each sector is physically connected in the tertiary structure, has a distinct functional role, and constitutes an independent mode of sequence divergence in the protein family. Functionally relevant sectors are evident in other protein families as well, suggesting that they may be general features of proteins. We propose that sectors represent a structural organization of proteins that reflects their evolutionary histories.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Uveal melanoma is the most common intraocular cancer. There are no effective therapies for metastatic disease. Mutations in GNAQ, the gene encoding an alpha subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, are found in 40% of uveal melanomas.

METHODS:We sequenced exon 5 of GNAQ and GNA11, a paralogue of GNAQ, in 713 melanocytic neoplasms of different types (186 uveal melanomas, 139 blue nevi, 106 other nevi, and 282 other melanomas). We sequenced exon 4 of GNAQ and GNA11 in 453 of these samples and in all coding exons of GNAQ and GNA11 in 97 uveal melanomas and 45 blue nevi.

RESULTS:We found somatic mutations in exon 5 (affecting Q209) and in exon 4 (affecting R183) in both GNA11 and GNAQ, in a mutually exclusive pattern. Mutations affecting Q209 in GNA11 were present in 7% of blue nevi, 32% of primary uveal melanomas, and 57% of uveal melanoma metastases. In contrast, we observed Q209 mutations in GNAQ in 55% of blue nevi, 45% of uveal melanomas, and 22% of uveal melanoma metastases. Mutations affecting R183 in either GNAQ or GNA11 were less prevalent (2% of blue nevi and 6% of uveal melanomas) than the Q209 mutations. Mutations in GNA11 induced spontaneously metastasizing tumors in a mouse model and activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.

CONCLUSIONS:Of the uveal melanomas we analyzed, 83% had somatic mutations in GNAQ or GNA11. Constitutive activation of the pathway involving these two genes appears to be a major contributor to the development of uveal melanoma. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.).},

It folds into an intricate tertiary structure upon addition of Mg(2+) ions, which is stabilized by the L11 protein in cocrystal structures. Here, we monitor the kinetics of its tertiary folding and Mg(2+)-dependent intermediate states by observing selected nucleobases that contribute specific interactions to the GAC tertiary structure in the cocrystals. The fluorescent nucleobase 2-aminopurine replaced three individual adenines, two of which make long-range stacking interactions and one that also forms hydrogen bonds. Each site reveals a unique response to Mg(2+) addition and temperature, reflecting its environmental change from secondary to tertiary structure. Stopped-flow fluorescence experiments revealed that kinetics of tertiary structure formation upon addition of MgCl2 are also site specific, with local conformational changes occurring from 5ms to 4s and with global folding from 1 to 5s. Site-specific substitution with (15)N-nucleobases allowed observation of stable hydrogen bond formation by NMR experiments. Equilibrium titration experiments indicate that a stable folding intermediate is present at stoichiometric concentrations of Mg(2+) and suggest that there are two initial sites of Mg(2+) ion association.},

The structures, together with other biophysical, computational docking and cell-based signaling data, reveal the orthosteric action of PMX53 and its effect of stabilizing the C5aR structure, as well as the allosteric action of chemically diverse non-peptide C5aR antagonists with different binding poses. Structural comparison analysis suggests the presence of similar allosteric sites in other GPCRs. We also discuss critical structural features of C5aR in activation, including a novel conformation of helix 8. On the basis of our results, we suggest novel strategies for developing C5aR-targeting drugs.},

abstract = {NMR investigations have been carried out on the B1 domain of protein G. This protein has six lysine residues, of which three are consistently found to form surface-exposed salt bridges in crystal structures, while the other three are not. The Nzeta and Hzeta chemical shifts of all six lysines are similar and are not affected significantly by pH titration of the carboxylate groups in the protein, except for a relatively small titration of K39 Nzeta. Deuterium isotope effects on nitrogen and proton are of the size expected for a simple hydrated amine (a result supported by density functional theory calculations), and also do not titrate with the carboxylates. The line shapes of the J-coupled (15)N signals suggest rapid internal reorientation of all NH(3)(+) groups. pK(a) values have been measured for all charged side chains except Glu50 and do not show the perturbations expected for salt bridge formation, except that E35 has a Hill coefficient of 0.84. The main differential effect seen is that the lysines that are involved in salt bridges in the crystal display faster exchange of the amine protons with the solvent, an effect attributed to general base catalysis by the carboxylates. This explanation is supported by varying buffer composition, which demonstrates reduced electrostatic shielding at low concentration. In conclusion, the study demonstrates that the six surface-exposed lysines in protein G are not involved in significant salt bridge interactions, even though such interactions are found consistently in crystal structures. However, the intrahelical E35-K39 (i,i+4) interaction is partially present.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of intra-protein communication is fundamental to such processes as allostery and signaling, yet comparatively little is understood about its physical origins despite notable progress in recent years. This review introduces contemporary but distinct frameworks for understanding intra-protein communication by presenting both the ideas behind them and a discussion of their successes and shortcomings. The first framework holds that intra-protein communication is accomplished by the sequential mechanical linkage of residues spanning a gap between distal sites. According to the second framework, proteins are best viewed as ensembles of distinct structural microstates, the dynamical and thermodynamic properties of which contribute to the experimentally observable macroscale properties. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful method for studying intra-protein communication, and the insights into both frameworks it provides are presented through a discussion of numerous examples from the literature. Distinct from mechanical and thermodynamic considerations of intra-protein communication are recently applied graph and network theoretic analyses. These computational methods reduce complex three dimensional protein architectures to simple maps comprised of nodes (residues) connected by edges (inter-residue "interactions"). Analysis of these graphs yields a characterization of the protein's topology and network characteristics. These methods have shown proteins to be "small world" networks with moderately high local residue connectivities existing concurrently with a small but significant number of long range connectivities. However, experimental studies of the tantalizing idea that these putative long range interaction pathways facilitate one or several macroscopic protein characteristics are unfortunately lacking at present. This review concludes by comparing and contrasting the presented frameworks and methodologies for studying intra-protein communication and suggests a manner in which they can be brought to bear simultaneously to further enhance our understanding of this important fundamental phenomenon.},

abstract = {The glass-like transition behavior of concentrated aqueous solutions of bovine serum albumin was examined using rheological techniques. At mass fractions >0.4, there was a marked concentration dependence of viscosity with a glass-like kinetic arrest observed at mass fractions in the region of 0.55. At mass fractions >0.6 the material behaved as a solid with a Young's modulus rising from approximately 20 MPa at a mass fraction of 0.62-1.1 GPa at 0.86. The solid was viscoelastic and exhibited stress relaxation with relaxation times increasing from 33 to 610 s over the same concentration range. The concentration dependence of the osmotic pressure was measured, at intermediate concentrations, using an osmotic stress technique and could be described using a hard sphere model, indicating that the intermolecular interactions were predominantly repulsive. In summary, a major structural relaxation results from the collective motion of the globules at the supra-globule length scale and, at 20 degrees C, this is arrested at water contents of 40% w/w. This appears to be analogous to the glass transition in colloidal hard spheres.},

abstract = {In recent years, spectral clustering has become one of the most popular modern clustering algorithms. It is simple to implement, can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm. On the first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does. The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions. We describe different graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral clustering algorithms are discussed.

abstract = {A generally applicable metadynamics scheme for predicting the free energy profile of ligand binding to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is described. A common and effective collective variable (CV) has been defined using the ideally placed and highly conserved Trp6.48 as a reference point for ligand-GPCR distance measurement and the common orientation of GPCRs in the cell membrane. Using this single CV together with well-tempered multiple-walker metadynamics with a funnel-like boundary allows an efficient exploration of the entire ligand binding path from the extracellular medium to the orthosteric binding site, including vestibule and intermediate sites. The protocol can be used with X-ray structures or high-quality homology models (based on a high-quality template and after thorough refinement) for the receptor and is universally applicable to agonists, antagonists, and partial and reverse agonists. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) in predicted binding free energies for 12 diverse ligands in five receptors (a total of 23 data points) is surprisingly small (less than 1 kcal mol(-1)). The RMSEs for simulations that use receptor X-ray structures and homology models are very similar.},

Here, we demonstrate a new method for library design that applies a previously developed bioinformatic method, Statistical Coupling Analysis (SCA). SCA uses homologous enzymes to identify amino acid positions that are mutable and functionally important and engage in synergistic interactions between amino acids. We use SCA to guide a library of the protein luciferase and demonstrate that, in a single round of selection, we can identify luciferase mutants with several valuable properties. Specifically, we identify luciferase mutants that possess both red-shifted emission spectra and improved stability relative to those of the wild-type enzyme. We also identify luciferase mutants that possess a >50-fold change in specificity for modified luciferins. To understand the mutational origin of these improved mutants, we demonstrate the role of mutations at N229, S239, and G246 in altered function. These studies show that SCA can be used to guide library design and rapidly identify synergistic amino acid mutations from a small library.},

The folding mechanism of this enzyme was investigated by kinetic and equilibrium experiments with the help of fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism. The equilibrium denaturation of the protein induced by guanidine hydrochloride occurs in two discrete steps, indicating the existence of a thermodynamically stable intermediate state. This state is 5.2 +/- 0.4 kcal/mol less stable than the native conformation and 5.7 +/- 0.2 kcal/mol more stable than the fully denatured protein. This intermediate state exhibits a high content of native secondary structure elements but is devoid of specific tertiary organization; its relation to the "molten globule" is discussed. Refolding kinetic experiments revealed the existence of a transient intermediate conformation between the thermodynamically stable intermediate and the native protein. This transient intermediate appears rapidly during the folding reaction. It exhibits a secondary structure content very similar to that of the native protein and has also recovered a significant amount of tertiary organisation. The final refolding step of the TEM-1 beta-lactamase, leading to the native enzyme, is dominated by two major slow kinetic phases which probably reflect a very complex process kinetically limited by proline cis/trans isomerization.},

The technique relies on the immobilization of one of the interactants, the ligand, onto a dextran-coated gold surface. The second interactant, the ligate, is then injected across the surface and the interaction of the soluble ligate with the immobilized ligand is observed continuously and directly. The process of dissociation of bound ligate may also be observed directly after the sample plug has traversed the layer. Thus, the data generated contain information on the kinetic rate and equilibrium binding constants for the interaction under investigation. Historically, data from this instrument have been analyzed in terms of linear transformations of the primary data and requires that data from several ligate concentrations be analyzed to determine a single value for the association and dissociation rate constants. Here we discuss the analysis of untransformed BIAcore data by nonlinear least squares methods. The primary data are analyzed according to the integrated rate equations which describe the kinetics of the interaction of soluble ligate with immobilized ligand and the dissociation of the formed complex from the surface, respectively. Such analyses allow the direct determination of the association and dissociation rate constants for each binding experiment and, further, allow the analysis of data over a wider concentration range with lower associated errors compared to previously described methods. Through the use of modeling these interactions, we also demonstrate the limitations in determining the dissociation rate constant from the association phase of the interaction, thereby requiring that the dissociation process be analyzed. Indeed, the dissociation phase should be analyzed first to yield a relatively precise and unambiguous value of the dissociation rate constant, kd, which can then be used to constrain the analysis of the association phase to yield a better estimate of the association rate constant, k(a). We further demonstrate that, at least for the interaction investigated, the apparent rate and equilibrium binding constants determined using SPR are concentration independent and can be determined with good reproducibility.},

abstract = {The reversible association of alpha and beta gamma subunits of GTP-binding proteins is important for signal transmission from a variety of cell-surface receptors to intracellular effectors. Previous work showed that 1,6-bis(maleimido)hexane, which crosslinks cysteine residues, crosslinks alpha o and alpha i-1 to beta gamma. These crosslinks are likely to form through a conserved cysteine because 1,6-bis(maleimido)hexane can also crosslink alpha i-2, alpha 1, alpha s and Drosophila alpha 1 to give products of the same apparent molecular weight as crosslinked alpha o beta gamma and alpha i-1 beta gamma. These proteins have only two cysteines in common. Therefore, we mutated each of the two conserved cysteines of alpha o to alanines. Mutation of Cys215 prevents crosslinking to beta gamma, but does not affect binding of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate or the ability of the mutated alpha subunit to bind beta gamma. In models of the alpha subunit based on the crystal structure of p21ras, Cys215 is located on the face opposite to the GTP-binding site and near an area that changes conformation depending on the nucleotide bound. This surface on the alpha subunit overlaps a putative effector binding region, raising important questions about the spatial organization of the proteins as they form ternary complexes. Mutation of Cys325 has no effect on crosslinking but, surprisingly, decreases by a factor of 10 the affinity of the mutated protein for GDP, relative to wild type, without changing the affinity for guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate. This mutation falls within a region thought to contact receptors and may represent a site through which receptors enhance the release of GDP.},

Signal output at steady state is a balance of the rates of GTP binding, which causes activation, and of GTP hydrolysis, which terminates activation. This GTPase catalytic cycle is regulated by receptors, which accelerate GTP binding, and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which accelerate hydrolysis. Receptors and GAPs similarly control the rates of signal initiation and termination. To allow independent control of signal amplitude and of the rates of turning the signal on and off, the activities of receptors and GAPs must be coordinated. Here, the principles of such coordination and the mechanisms by which it is achieved are discussed.},

The analytics takes advantage of the detailed time series available from biomolecular computer simulations, and it yields spatial heat maps that can be visualized on 3D molecular structures or in the form of interaction networks. The speed of our efficient mutual information solver is on the order of a basic Pearson cross-correlation calculation. We demonstrate that the FIM method is superior to linear cross-correlation for the detection of nonlinear dependence in challenging situations where measures for the global dynamics (the "activity") diverge. The analytics is applied to the detection of hinge-bending hot spots and to the prediction of pairwise contacts between residues that are relevant for the global activity exhibited by the molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. Application examples from various MD laboratories include the millisecond bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) trajectory using canonical MD, a Gaussian accelerated MD folding trajectory of chignolin, and the heat-induced unfolding of engrailed homeodomain (EnHD). The FIM implementation will be freely disseminated with our open-source package, TimeScapes.},

Therefore, the flexibility of cavities should be guaranteed by protein vibrational dynamics. Molecular dynamics simulations provide a framework to explore conformational plasticity of protein cavities. Herein, we present a novel procedure to characterize the dynamics of protein cavities in terms of their volume gradient vector. For this purpose, we make use of algorithms for calculation of the cavity volume that result robust for numerical differentiations. Volume gradient vector is expressed in terms of principal component analysis obtained from equilibrated molecular dynamics simulations. We analyze contributions of principal component modes to the volume gradient vector according to their frequency and degree of delocalization. In all our test cases, we find that low frequency modes play a critical role together with minor contributions of high frequency modes. These modes involve concerted motions of significant fractions of the total residues lining the cavities. We make use of variations of the potential energy of a protein in the direction of the volume gradient vector as a measure of flexibility of the cavity. We show that proteins whose collective low frequency fluctuations contribute the most to changes of cavity volume exhibit more flexible cavities.},

Markov state models (MSMs) are powerful kinetic network models that can predict long-time-scale dynamics using many short molecular dynamics simulations. Although MSMs have been successfully applied to conformational changes of individual proteins, the analysis of multibody systems is still a challenge because of the complexity of the dynamics that occur on a mixture of drastically different time scales. In this work, we have developed a new algorithm, automatic state partitioning for multibody systems (APM), for constructing MSMs to elucidate the conformational dynamics of multibody systems. The APM algorithm effectively addresses different time scales in the multibody systems by directly incorporating dynamics into geometric clustering when identifying the metastable conformational states. We have applied the APM algorithm to a 2D potential that can mimic a protein-ligand binding system and the aggregation of two hydrophobic particles in water and have shown that it can yield tremendous enhancements in the computational efficiency of MSM construction and the accuracy of the models.},

These proteins have very little sequence homology, but they all have an unusual arrangement of six cysteines linked to form a "cystine-knot" conformation. The active forms of these proteins are dimers, either homo- or heterodimers. Despite the overall topological similarity between the monomers, the interfaces used to form the dimer are in each case quite different. Because the surfaces used for dimer formation are mostly hydrophobic, the uniqueness of each dimer accounts for the lack of sequence homology and raises questions about the effectiveness of reverse sequence fitting in this kind of structure as a predictor of structural homology.},

To explore the effect of phosphorylation on PSD-95, we used semisynthetic strategies to introduce phosphorylated amino acids at four positions within the PDZ domains and examined the effects on interactions with a large set of binding partners. We observed complex effects on affinity. Most notably, phosphorylation at Y397 induced a significant increase in affinity for stargazin, as confirmed by NMR and single molecule FRET. Additionally, we compared the effects of phosphorylation to phosphomimetic mutations, which revealed that phosphomimetics are ineffective substitutes for tyrosine phosphorylation.

While the consensus sequence motif has been identified and used to explain substrate specificity for PKC$\alpha$, it does not inform the structural basis of substrate binding and kinase activity for diverse substrates phosphorylated by this kinase. The transient, dynamic, and unstructured nature of this protein-protein interaction has limited structural mapping of kinase-substrate interfaces. Here, using multiscale MD simulation-based predictions and FRET sensor-based experiments, we investigated the conformational dynamics of the kinase-substrate interface. We found that the binding strength of the kinase-substrate interaction is primarily determined by long-range columbic interactions between basic (Arg/Lys) residues located N-terminally to the phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues in the substrate and by an acidic patch in the kinase catalytic domain. Kinase activity stemmed from conformational flexibility in the region C-terminal to the phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues. Flexibility of the substrate-kinase interaction enabled an Arg/Lys two to three amino acids C-terminal to the phosphorylated Ser/Thr to prime a catalytically active conformation, facilitating phosphoryl transfer to the substrate. The structural mechanisms determining substrate binding and catalytic activity formed the basis of diverse binding affinities and kinase activities of PKC$\alpha$ for 14 substrates with varying degrees of sequence conservation. Our findings provide insight into the dynamic properties of the kinase-substrate interaction that govern substrate binding and turnover. Moreover, this study establishes a modeling and experimental method to elucidate the structural dynamics underlying substrate selectivity among eukaryotic kinases.},

abstract = {Under normal cellular conditions, the tumor suppressor protein p53 is kept at low levels in part due to ubiquitination by MDM2, a process initiated by binding of MDM2 to the intrinsically disordered transactivation domain (TAD) of p53. Many experimental and simulation studies suggest that disordered domains such as p53 TAD bind their targets nonspecifically before folding to a tightly associated conformation, but the microscopic details are unclear. Toward a detailed prediction of binding mechanisms, pathways, and rates, we have performed large-scale unbiased all-atom simulations of p53-MDM2 binding. Markov state models (MSMs) constructed from the trajectory data predict p53 TAD binding pathways and on-rates in good agreement with experiment. The MSM reveals that two key bound intermediates, each with a nonnative arrangement of hydrophobic residues in the MDM2 binding cleft, control the overall on-rate. Using microscopic rate information from the MSM, we parameterize a simple four-state kinetic model to 1) determine that induced-fit pathways dominate the binding flux over a large range of concentrations, and 2) predict how modulation of residual p53 helicity affects binding, in good agreement with experiment. These results suggest new ways in which microscopic models of peptide binding, coupled with simple few-state binding flux models, can be used to understand biological function in physiological contexts.},

The aim is to develop a new tool for studying rare events and exploring complex free energy landscapes. Metadynamics is a well-established and widely used enhanced sampling method whose efficiency depends on an appropriate choice of collective variables. Often the initial choice is not optimal leading to slow convergence. However by analyzing the dynamics generated in one such run with a time-lagged independent component analysis and the techniques recently developed in the area of conformational dynamics, we obtain much more efficient collective variables that are also better capable of illuminating the physics of the system. We demonstrate the power of this approach in two paradigmatic examples.},

The classical example is mayonnaise: a mixture of two low-viscosity liquids, water and oil, is structured through the addition of a surfactant creating a dispersed phase, causing the viscosity to increase a thousand-fold. The dramatic increase in viscosity in highly concentrated solutions is a long-standing unsolved problem in physical chemistry. Here we will show that this viscosity increase can be understood in terms of the solute-induced structuring of the first solvation shell, leading to a jamming transition at a critical concentration. As the jamming transition is approached, the viscosity naturally increases according to a Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann type expression. This result calls into question the validity of the Jones-Dole B-coefficient as an indicator of the structure making or breaking ability of solutes.},

abstract = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) form the largest family of receptors encoded by the human genome (around 800 genes). They transduce signals by coupling to a small number of heterotrimeric G proteins (16 genes encoding different $\alpha$-subunits). Each human cell contains several GPCRs and G proteins. The structural determinants of coupling of Gs to four different GPCRs have been elucidated1-4, but the molecular details of how the other G-protein classes couple to GPCRs are unknown. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the serotonin 5-HT1B receptor (5-HT1BR) bound to the agonist donitriptan and coupled to an engineered Go heterotrimer. In this complex, 5-HT1BR is in an active state; the intracellular domain of the receptor is in a similar conformation to that observed for the $\beta$2-adrenoceptor ($\beta$2AR) 3 or the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) 1 in complex with Gs. In contrast to the complexes with Gs, the gap between the receptor and the G$\beta$-subunit in the Go-5-HT1BR complex precludes molecular contacts, and the interface between the G$\alpha$-subunit of Go and the receptor is considerably smaller. These differences are likely to be caused by the differences in the interactions with the C terminus of the Go $\alpha$-subunit. The molecular variations between the interfaces of Go and Gs in complex with GPCRs may contribute substantially to both the specificity of coupling and the kinetics of signalling.},

In agreement with our earlier investigation using GROMACS 4.6 on hardware of 2014, the performance to price ratio of consumer GPU nodes is considerably higher than that of CPU nodes. However, with GROMACS 2018, the optimal CPU to GPU processing power balance has shifted even more towards the GPU. Hence, nodes optimized for GROMACS 2018 and later versions enable a significantly higher performance to price ratio than nodes optimized for older GROMACS versions. Moreover, the shift towards GPU processing allows to cheaply upgrade old nodes with recent GPUs, yielding essentially the same performance as comparable brand-new hardware.},

abstract = {The C5a chemoattractant factor receptor, when expressed in COS-7 cells, can stimulate phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C activity through the activation of the G16 isoform of the heterotrimeric G protein, but not through the G11 isoform. To identify the regions of the G alpha 16 subunit protein that are responsible for its activation by the C5a receptor, a series of chimeras between G alpha 16 and G alpha 11 were constructed and tested for their ability to be activated by the C5a receptor. Co-transfection experiments with chimeras in which the carboxyl-terminal regions of G alpha 11 were replaced with the corresponding regions of G alpha 16 demonstrated that changes in the carboxyl terminus, e.g., replacement of 134 amino acids, were not sufficient to confer receptor specificity. An additional segment encompassing residues 220-240 of G alpha 16 was required to confer C5a-induced activation. Testing of a reciprocal series of chimeras composed of G alpha 16 sequences at the amino terminus and G alpha 11 sequences at the carboxyl terminus revealed that certain sequences extending from the amino terminus to amino acid 209 of G alpha 16 were sufficient to endow the chimera with much of the specificity for C5a-induced activation. These results suggest that receptor specificity may involve specific conformations of the G protein stabilized by concerted interactions of multiple amino acid sequences distributed throughout the G alpha protein.},

abstract = {G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are one of the largest families of membrane receptors in eukaryotes. Heterotrimeric G-proteins, composed of $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ subunits, are important molecular switches in the mediation of GPCR signaling. Receptor stimulation after the binding of a suitable ligand leads to G-protein heterotrimer activation and dissociation into the G$\alpha$ subunit and G$\beta$$\gamma$ heterodimer. These subunits then interact with a large number of effectors, leading to several cell responses. We studied the interactions between G$\alpha$ subunits and their binding partners, using information from structural, mutagenesis and Bioinformatics studies, and conducted a series of comparisons of sequence, structure, electrostatic properties and intermolecular energies among different G$\alpha$ families and subfamilies. We identified a number of G$\alpha$ surfaces that may, in several occasions, participate in interactions with receptors as well as effectors. The study of G$\alpha$ interacting surfaces in terms of sequence, structure and electrostatic potential reveals features that may account for the G$\alpha$ subunit's behavior towards its interacting partners. The electrostatic properties of the G$\alpha$ subunits, which in some cases differ greatly not only between families but also between subfamilies, as well as the G-protein interacting surfaces of effectors and regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) suggest that electrostatic complementarity may be an important factor in G-protein interactions. Energy calculations also support this notion. This information may be useful in future studies of G-protein interactions with GPCRs and effectors.},

Contacts along the inner surface of TM5 and TM6 induce an alpha-helical conformation in GalphaCT with a C-terminal reverse turn. Main-chain carbonyl groups in the reverse turn constitute the centre of a hydrogen-bonded network, which links the two receptor regions containing the conserved E(D)RY and NPxxY(x)(5,6)F motifs.

The free energy surfaces underlying these processes can be obtained from simulations using enhanced sampling methods. However, their altered dynamics makes kinetic and mechanistic information difficult or impossible to extract. Here, we show that, with replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD), one can not only sample equilibrium properties but also extract kinetic information. For systems that strictly obey first-order kinetics, the procedure to extract rates is rigorous. For actual molecular systems whose long-time dynamics are captured by kinetic rate models, accurate rate coefficients can be determined from the statistics of the transitions between the metastable states at each replica temperature. We demonstrate the practical applicability of the procedure by constructing master equation (Markov state) models of peptide and RNA folding from REMD simulations.},

abstract = {Folded protein structures are both stable and dynamic. Historically, our clearest window into these structures came from X-ray crystallography, which generally provided a static image of each protein's singular "folded state", highlighting its stability. Deviations away from that crystallographic structure were difficult to quantify, and as a result, their potential functional consequences were often neglected. However, several dynamical and statistical studies now highlight the structural variability that is present within the protein's folded state. Here we review mounting evidence of the importance of these structural rearrangements; both experiment and computation indicate that folded proteins undergo substantial fluctuations that can greatly influence their function. Crucially, recent studies have shown that structural elements of proteins, especially their side-chain degrees of freedom, fluctuate in ways that generate significant conformational heterogeneity. The entropy associated with these motions contributes to the folded structure's thermodynamic stability. In addition, since these fluctuations can shift in response to perturbations such as ligand binding, they may play an important role in the protein's capacity to respond to environmental cues. In one compelling example, the entropy associated with side-chain fluctuations contributes significantly to regulating the binding of calmodulin to a set of peptide ligands. The neglect of fluctuations within proteins' native states was often justified by the dense packing within folded proteins, which has inspired comparisons with crystalline solids. Many liquids, however, can achieve similarly dense packing yet fluidity is maintained through correlated molecular motions. Indeed, the studies we discuss favor comparison of folded proteins not with solids but instead with dense liquids, where the internal side chain fluidity is facilitated by collective motions that are correlated over long distances. These correlated rearrangements can enable allosteric communication between different parts of a protein, through subtle and varied channels. Such long-range correlations appear to be an innate feature of proteins in general, manifest even in molecules lacking known allosteric regulators and arising robustly from the physical nature of their internal environment. Given their ubiquity, it is only to be expected that, over time, nature has refined some subset of these correlated motions and put them to use. Native state fluctuations increasingly appear to be vital for proteins' natural functions. Understanding the diversity, origin, and range of these rearrangements may provide novel routes for rationally manipulating biomolecular activity.},

abstract = {The variational principles called maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and maximum caliber (MaxCal) are reviewed. MaxEnt originated in the statistical physics of Boltzmann and Gibbs, as a theoretical tool for predicting the equilibrium states of thermal systems. Later, entropy maximization was also applied to matters of information, signal transmission, and image reconstruction. Recently, since the work of Shore and Johnson, MaxEnt has been regarded as a principle that is broader than either physics or information alone. MaxEnt is a procedure that ensures that inferences drawn from stochastic data satisfy basic self-consistency requirements. The different historical justifications for the entropy $S=\ensuremath{-}\ensuremath{\sum}_{i}{p}_{i}\mathrm{log}﻿{p}_{i}$ and its corresponding variational principles are reviewed. As an illustration of the broadening purview of maximum entropy principles, maximum caliber, which is path entropy maximization applied to the trajectories of dynamical systems, is also reviewed. Examples are given in which maximum caliber is used to interpret dynamical fluctuations in biology and on the nanoscale, in single-molecule and few-particle systems such as molecular motors, chemical reactions, biological feedback circuits, and diffusion in microfluidics devices.},

Here we describe molecular dynamics simulations, bioinformatics analysis, and experimental mutagenesis that identifies residues involved in mediating the allosteric coupling of receptor, nucleotide, and helical domain interfaces of G$\alpha$i. Most notably, we predict and characterize novel allosteric decoupling mutants, which display enhanced helical domain opening, increased rates of nucleotide exchange, and constitutive activity in the absence of receptor activation. Collectively, our results provide a framework for explaining how binding events and mutations can alter internal dynamic couplings critical for G protein function.},

abstract = {Poxviruses encode a broad array of proteins that serve to undermine host immune defenses. Structural analysis of four of these seemingly unrelated proteins revealed the recurrent use of a conserved beta-sandwich fold that has not been observed in any eukaryotic or prokaryotic protein. Herein we propose to call this unique structural scaffolding the PIE (Poxvirus Immune Evasion) domain. PIE domain containing proteins are abundant in chordopoxvirinae, with our analysis identifying 20 likely PIE subfamilies among 33 representative genomes spanning 7 genera. For example, cowpox strain Brighton Red appears to encode 10 different PIEs: vCCI, A41, C8, M2, T4 (CPVX203), and the SECRET proteins CrmB, CrmD, SCP-1, SCP-2, and SCP-3. Characterized PIE proteins all appear to be nonessential for virus replication, and all contain signal peptides for targeting to the secretory pathway. The PIE subfamilies differ primarily in the number, size, and location of structural embellishments to the beta-sandwich core that confer unique functional specificities. Reported ligands include chemokines, GM-CSF, IL-2, MHC class I, and glycosaminoglycans. We expect that the list of ligands and receptors engaged by the PIE domain will grow as we come to better understand how this versatile structural architecture can be tailored to manipulate host responses to infection.},

abstract = {Cardiac hypertrophy is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Activation of G(q/11)-mediated signaling is required for pressure overload-induced cardiomyocyte (CM) hypertrophy to develop. We previously showed that among Regulators of G protein Signaling, RGS2 selectively inhibits G(q/11) signaling and its hypertrophic effects in isolated CM. In this study, we generated transgenic mice with CM-specific, conditional RGS2 expression (dTG) to investigate whether RGS2 overexpression can be used to attenuate G(q/11)-mediated signaling and hypertrophy in vivo. Transverse aortic constriction (TAC) induced a comparable rise in ventricular mass and ANF expression and corresponding hemodynamic changes in dTG compared to wild types (WT), regardless of the TAC duration (1-8 wks) and timing of RGS2 expression (from birth or adulthood). Inhibition of endothelin-1-induced G(q/11)-mediated phospholipase C $\beta$ activity in ventricles and atrial appendages indicated functionality of transgenic RGS2. However, the inhibitory effect of transgenic RGS2 on G(q/11)-mediated PLC$\beta$ activation differed between ventricles and atria: (i) in sham-operated dTG mice the magnitude of the inhibitory effect was less pronounced in ventricles than in atria, and (ii) after TAC, negative regulation of G(q/11) signaling was absent in ventricles but fully preserved in atria. Neither difference could be explained by differences in expression levels, including marked RGS2 downregulation after TAC in left ventricle and atrium. Counter-regulatory changes in other G(q/11)-regulating RGS proteins (RGS4, RGS5, RGS6) and random insertion were also excluded as potential causes. Taken together, despite ample evidence for a role of RGS2 in negatively regulating G(q/11) signaling and hypertrophy in CM, CM-specific RGS2 overexpression in transgenic mice in vivo did not lead to attenuate ventricular G(q/11)-mediated signaling and hypertrophy in response to pressure overload. Furthermore, our study suggests chamber-specific differences in the regulation of RGS2 functionality and potential future utility of the new transgenic model in mitigating G(q/11) signaling in the atria in vivo.},

abstract = {Correlated motions of proteins are critical to function, but these features are difficult to resolve using traditional structure determination techniques. Time-resolved X-ray methods hold promise for addressing this challenge, but have relied on the exploitation of exotic protein photoactivity, and are therefore not generalizable. Temperature jumps, through thermal excitation of the solvent, have been utilized to study protein dynamics using spectroscopic techniques, but their implementation in X-ray scattering experiments has been limited. Here, we perform temperature-jump small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements on a dynamic enzyme, cyclophilin A, demonstrating that these experiments are able to capture functional intramolecular protein dynamics on the microsecond timescale. We show that cyclophilin A displays rich dynamics following a temperature jump, and use the resulting time-resolved signal to assess the kinetics of conformational changes. Two relaxation processes are resolved: a fast process is related to surface loop motions, and a slower process is related to motions in the core of the protein that are critical for catalytic turnover.},

abstract = {Extracellular signals prompt G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to adopt an active conformation (R*) and catalyze GDP/GTP exchange in the alpha-subunit of intracellular G proteins (Galphabetagamma). Kinetic analysis of transducin (G(t)alphabetagamma) activation shows that an intermediary R*xG(t)alphabetagamma.GDP complex is formed that precedes GDP release and formation of the nucleotide-free R*xG protein complex. Based on this reaction sequence, we explore the dynamic interface between the proteins during formation of these complexes. We start from the R* conformation stabilized by a G(t)alpha C-terminal peptide (GalphaCT) obtained from crystal structures of the GPCR opsin. Molecular modeling allows reconstruction of the fully elongated C-terminal alpha-helix of G(t)alpha (alpha5) and shows how alpha5 can be docked to the open binding site of R*. Two modes of interaction are found. One of them--termed stable or S-interaction--matches the position of the GalphaCT peptide in the crystal structure and reproduces the hydrogen-bonding networks between the C-terminal reverse turn of GalphaCT and conserved E(D)RY and NPxxY(x)(5,6)F regions of the GPCR. The alternative fit--termed intermediary or I-interaction--is distinguished by a tilt (42 degrees ) and rotation (90 degrees ) of alpha5 relative to the S-interaction and shows different alpha5 contacts with the NPxxY(x)(5,6)F region and the second cytoplasmic loop of R*. From the 2 alpha5 interactions, we derive a "helix switch" mechanism for the transition of R*xG(t)alphabetagamma.GDP to the nucleotide-free R*xG protein complex that illustrates how alpha5 might act as a transmission rod to propagate the conformational change from the receptor-G protein interface to the nucleotide binding site.},

While backbone motions have long been considered essential for long-range information conveyance, side-chain motions have rarely been considered. In this work, we demonstrate their potential utility using Monte Carlo sampling of side-chain torsional angles on a fixed backbone to quantify correlations amongst side-chain inter-rotameric motions. Results indicate that long-range correlations of side-chain fluctuations can arise independently from several different types of interactions: steric repulsions, implicit solvent interactions, or hydrogen bonding and salt-bridge interactions. These robust correlations persist across the entire protein (up to 60 {\AA} in the case of calmodulin) and can propagate long-range changes in side-chain variability in response to single residue perturbations.},

abstract = {Motional displacements of hydrogen (H) in proteins can be measured using incoherent neutron-scattering methods. These displacements can also be calculated numerically using data from molecular dynamics simulations. An enormous amount of data on the average mean-square motional displacement (MSD) of H as a function of protein temperature, hydration, and other conditions has been collected. H resides in a wide spectrum of sites in a protein. Some H are tightly bound to molecular chains, and the H motion is dictated by that of the chain. Other H are quite independent. As a result, there is a distribution of motions and MSDs of H within a protein that is denoted dynamical heterogeneity. The goal of this paper is to incorporate a distribution of MSDs into models of the H incoherent intermediate scattering function, I(Q,t), that is calculated and observed. The aim is to contribute information on the distribution as well as on the average MSD from comparison of the models with simulations and experiment. For example, we find that simulations of~I(Q,t) in lysozyme are well reproduced if the distribution of MSDs is bimodal with two broad peaks rather than a single broad peak.},

abstract = {Correlated motions in biomolecules are often essential for their function, e.g., allosteric signal transduction or mechanical/thermodynamic energy transport. Because correlated motions in biomolecules remain difficult to access experimentally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are particular useful for their analysis. The established method to quantify correlations from MD simulations via calculation of the covariance matrix, however, is restricted to linear correlations and therefore misses part of the correlations in the atomic fluctuations. Herein, we propose a general statistical mechanics approach to detect and quantify any correlated motion from MD trajectories. This generalized correlation measure is contrasted with correlations obtained from covariance matrices for the B1 domain of protein G and T4 lysozyme. The new method successfully quantifies correlations and provides a valuable global overview over the functionally relevant collective motions of lysozyme. In particular, correlated motions of helix 1 together with the two main lobes of lysozyme are detected, which are not seen by the conventional covariance matrix. Overall, the established method misses more than 50% of the correlation. This failure is attributed to both, an interfering and unnecessary dependence on mutual orientations of the atomic fluctuations and, to a lesser extent, attributed to nonlinear correlations. Our generalized correlation measure overcomes these problems and, moreover, allows for an improved understanding of the conformational dynamics by separating linear and nonlinear contributions of the correlation.},

Here we present structures of human NTSR1 in complex with the agonist JMV449 and the heterotrimeric Gi1 protein, at a resolution of 3~{\AA}. We identify two conformations: a canonical-state complex that is similar to recently reported GPCR-Gi/o complexes (in which the nucleotide-binding pocket adopts more~flexible conformations that may facilitate nucleotide exchange), and a non-canonical state in which the G protein is rotated by about 45~degrees relative to the receptor and exhibits a more rigid nucleotide-binding pocket. In the non-canonical state, NTSR1 exhibits features of both active and inactive conformations, which suggests that the structure may represent an intermediate form along the activation pathway of G proteins. This structural information, complemented by molecular dynamics simulations and functional studies, provides insights into the complex process of G-protein activation.},

abstract = {Heterotrimeric guanine-nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) act as molecular switches in signaling pathways by coupling the activation of heptahelical receptors at the cell surface to intracellular responses. In the resting state, the G-protein alpha subunit (Galpha) binds GDP and Gbetagamma. Receptors activate G proteins by catalyzing GTP for GDP exchange on Galpha, leading to a structural change in the Galpha(GTP) and Gbetagamma subunits that allows the activation of a variety of downstream effector proteins. The G protein returns to the resting conformation following GTP hydrolysis and subunit re-association. As the G-protein cycle progresses, the Galpha subunit traverses through a series of conformational changes. Crystallographic studies of G proteins in many of these conformations have provided substantial insight into the structures of these proteins, the GTP-induced structural changes in Galpha, how these changes may lead to subunit dissociation and allow Galpha and Gbetagamma to activate effector proteins, as well as the mechanism of GTP hydrolysis. However, relatively little is known about the receptor-G protein complex and how this interaction leads to GDP release from Galpha. This article reviews the structural determinants of the function of heterotrimeric G proteins in mammalian systems at each point in the G-protein cycle with special emphasis on the mechanism of receptor-mediated G-protein activation. The receptor-G protein complex has proven to be a difficult target for crystallography, and several biophysical and computational approaches are discussed that complement the currently available structural information to improve models of this interaction. Additionally, these approaches enable the study of G-protein dynamics in solution, which is becoming an increasingly appreciated component of all aspects of G-protein signaling.},

abstract = {Pertussis toxin (PTX) is a typical A-B toxin. The A-protomer (S1 subunit) exhibits ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. The B-oligomer consists of four subunits (S2 to S5) and binds extracellular molecules that allow the toxin to enter the cells. The A-protomer ADP-ribosylates the $\alpha$ subunits of heterotrimeric Gi/o proteins, resulting in the receptors being uncoupled from the Gi/o proteins. The B-oligomer binds proteins expressed on the cell surface, such as Toll-like receptor 4, and activates an intracellular signal transduction cascade. Thus, PTX modifies cellular responses by at least two different signaling pathways; ADP-ribosylation of the G$\alpha$i/o proteins by the A-protomer (Gi/o protein-dependent action) and the interaction of the B-oligomer with cell surface proteins (Gi/o protein-independent action).},

abstract = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signal primarily through G proteins or arrestins. Arrestin binding to GPCRs blocks G protein interaction and redirects signalling to numerous G-protein-independent pathways. Here we report the crystal structure of a constitutively active form of human rhodopsin bound to a pre-activated form of the mouse visual arrestin, determined by serial femtosecond X-ray laser crystallography. Together with extensive biochemical and mutagenesis data, the structure reveals an overall architecture of the rhodopsin-arrestin assembly in which rhodopsin uses distinct structural elements, including transmembrane helix 7 and helix 8, to recruit arrestin. Correspondingly, arrestin adopts the pre-activated conformation, with a ∼20{\textdegree} rotation between the amino and carboxy domains, which opens up a cleft in arrestin to accommodate a short helix formed by the second intracellular loop of rhodopsin. This structure provides a basis for understanding GPCR-mediated arrestin-biased signalling and demonstrates the power of X-ray lasers for advancing the frontiers of structural biology.},

abstract = {Regulator of G protein signaling 2 (RGS2) controls signaling by receptors coupled to the Gq/11 class heterotrimeric G proteins. RGS2 deficiency causes several phenotypes in mice and occurs in several diseases, including hypertension where a proteolytically unstable RGS2 mutant has been reported. However, the mechanisms and functions of RGS2 proteolysis remain poorly understood. Here we addressed these questions by identifying degradation signals in RGS2, and studying dynamic regulation of Gq/11-evoked Ca2+ signaling and vascular contraction. We identified a novel bipartite degradation signal in the N-terminal domain of RGS2. Mutations disrupting this signal blunted proteolytic degradation downstream of E3 ubiquitin ligase binding to RGS2. Analysis of RGS2 mutants proteolyzed at various rates and the effects of proteasome inhibition indicated that proteolytic degradation controls agonist efficacy by setting RGS2 protein expression levels, and affecting the rate that cells regain agonist responsiveness as synthesis of RGS2 stops. Analyzing contraction of mesenteric resistance arteries supported the biological relevance of this mechanism. Because RGS2 mRNA expression often is strikingly and transiently up- and then down-regulated upon cell stimulation, our findings indicate that proteolytic degradation tightly couples RGS2 transcription, protein levels and function. Together these mechanisms provide tight temporal control of Gq/11-coupled receptor signaling in the cardiovascular, immune and nervous systems.},

abstract = {Heterotrimeric G proteins are expressed in virtually all cell and tissue types and are involved in most physiologic and pathologic processes. As such, understanding the structural mechanism of G protein activation has been a top priority in the field, aimed at developing more effective pharmacological interventions. Recent breakthrough studies have elucidated the structural basis for G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-dependent G protein activation. In contrast, the structural basis of GPCR-independent G protein activation has remained elusive. The present study reveals the structural and dynamical basis for GPCR-independent G$\alpha$i activation by guanine-nucleotide exchange modulators (GEMs) and identifies key similarities and differences between GPCR-dependent and -independent activation mechanisms. These insights will be invaluable for efforts of selective pharmacological targeting of GEMs to treat GEM-driven diseases. Heterotrimeric G proteins are key molecular switches that control cell behavior. The canonical activation of G proteins by agonist-occupied G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) has recently been elucidated from the structural perspective. In contrast, the structural basis for GPCR-independent G protein activation by a novel family of guanine-nucleotide exchange modulators (GEMs) remains unknown. Here, we present a 2.0-{\AA} crystal structure of G$\alpha$i in complex with the GEM motif of GIV/Girdin. Nucleotide exchange assays, molecular dynamics simulations, and hydrogen{\textendash}deuterium exchange experiments demonstrate that GEM binding to the conformational switch II causes structural changes that allosterically propagate to the hydrophobic core of the G$\alpha$i GTPase domain. Rearrangement of the hydrophobic core appears to be a common mechanism by which GPCRs and GEMs activate G proteins, although with different efficiency. Atomic-level insights presented here will aid structure-based efforts to selectively target the noncanonical G protein activation.},

The general principles of protein structure that underlie this process remain unknown. Here, we describe a sequence-based statistical method for quantitatively mapping the global network of amino acid interactions in a protein. Application of this method for three structurally and functionally distinct protein families (G protein-coupled receptors, the chymotrypsin class of serine proteases and hemoglobins) reveals a surprisingly simple architecture for amino acid interactions in each protein family: a small subset of residues forms physically connected networks that link distant functional sites in the tertiary structure. Although small in number, residues comprising the network show excellent correlation with the large body of mechanistic data available for each family. The data suggest that evolutionarily conserved sparse networks of amino acid interactions represent structural motifs for allosteric communication in proteins.},

The approach relates conditional probabilities to the probabilities of the corresponding state transitions. This in turn characterises transfer entropy as a difference of two entropy rates: the rate for a resultant transition and another rate for a possibly irreversible transition within the system affected by an additional source. We then show that this difference, the local transfer entropy, is proportional to the external entropy production, possibly due to irreversibility. Near equilibrium, transfer entropy is also interpreted as the difference in equilibrium stabilities with respect to two scenarios: a default case and the case with an additional source. Finally, we demonstrated that such a thermodynamic treatment is not applicable to information flow, a measure of causal effect.},

Our previous work has demonstrated that Poisson-Boltzmann methods are capable of faithfully reproducing polar explicit solvent forces for dilute protein systems; however, the popular solvent-accessible surface area model was shown to be incapable of accurately describing nonpolar solvation forces at atomic-length scales. Therefore, alternate continuum methods are needed to reproduce nonpolar interactions at the atomic scale. In the present work, we address this issue by supplementing the solvent-accessible surface area model with additional volume and dispersion integral terms suggested by scaled particle models and Weeks-Chandler-Andersen theory, respectively. This more complete nonpolar implicit solvent model shows very good agreement with explicit solvent results and suggests that, although often overlooked, the inclusion of appropriate dispersion and volume terms are essential for an accurate implicit solvent description of atomic-scale nonpolar forces.},

It has been postulated that EPKs{\textquoteright} active and inactive states depend on the structural architecture of their hydrophobic cores, organized around two highly conserved spines: C-spine and R-spine. How the spines orchestrate the transition of the enzyme between catalytically uncommitted and committed states remains elusive. Using relaxation dispersion nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we found that the hydrophobic core of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, a prototypical and ubiquitous EPK, moves synchronously to poise the C subunit for catalysis in response to binding adenosine 5{\textasciiacute}-triphosphate. In addition to completing the C-spine, the adenine ring fuses the $\beta$ structures of the N-lobe and the C-lobe. Additional residues that bridge the two spines (I150 and V104) are revealed as part of the correlated hydrophobic network; their importance was validated by mutagenesis, which led to inactivation. Because the hydrophobic architecture of the catalytic core is conserved throughout the EPK superfamily, the present study suggests a universal mechanism for dynamically driven allosteric activation of kinases mediated by coordinated signal transmission through ordered motifs in their hydrophobic cores.},

The asymmetry of the measure allows feedback evaluations. In particular, this tool has potential applications in investigating windows of temporal integration and stimulus-induced modulation of firing rate. Transfer entropy is also able to eliminate some effects of common history in spike trains and obtains results that are different from cross-correlation. The basic transfer entropy properties are illustrated with simulations. The information transfer through a network of 16 simultaneous multiunit recordings in cat's auditory cortex was examined for a large number of acoustic stimulus types. Application of the transfer entropy to a large database of multiple single-unit activity in cat's primary auditory cortex revealed that most windows of temporal integration found during spontaneous activity range between 2 and 15 ms. The normalized transfer entropy shows similarities and differences with the strength of cross-correlation; these form the basis for revisiting the neural assembly concept.},

Here we introduce a comprehensive computational approach to effective prediction of stabilizing mutations in GPCRs, named CompoMug, which employs sequence-based analysis, structural information, and a derived machine learning predictor. Tested experimentally on the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor target, CompoMug predictions resulted in 10 new stabilizing mutations, with an apparent thermostability gain {\textasciitilde}8.8{\textdegree}C for the best single mutation and {\textasciitilde}13{\textdegree}C for a triple mutant. Binding of antagonists confers further stabilization for the triple mutant receptor, with total gains of {\textasciitilde}21{\textdegree}C as compared to wild type apo 5-HT2C. The predicted mutations enabled crystallization and structure determination for the 5-HT2C receptor complexes in inactive and active-like states. While CompoMug already shows high 25% hit rate and utility in GPCR structural studies, further improvements are expected with accumulation of structural and mutation data.},

However, in silico modelling of the conformational ensembles of these enzymes is difficult due to inherent limitations and the cost of computational approaches. Recent algorithmic advances combined with homology modelling and parallel simulations have enabled researchers to address this computational sampling bottleneck. Here, we present the results of molecular dynamics studies for seven Src family kinase (SFK) members: Fyn, Lyn, Lck, Hck, Fgr, Yes and Blk. We present a sequence invariant extension to Markov state models, which allows us to quantitatively compare the structural ensembles of the seven kinases. Our findings indicate that in the absence of their regulatory partners, SFK members have similar in silico dynamics with active state populations ranging from 4 to 40% and activation timescales in the hundreds of microseconds. Furthermore, we observe several potentially druggable intermediate states, including a pocket next to the adenosine triphosphate binding site that could potentially be targeted via a small-molecule inhibitor.},

Attempts to design novel proteins with tailored functions have mostly failed to yield efficiencies matching those found in nature because standard methods do not allow the design of exchange between necessary conformational states on a functionally relevant timescale. Here we developed a broadly applicable computational method to engineer protein dynamics that we term meta-multistate design. We used this methodology to design spontaneous exchange between two novel conformations introduced into the global fold of Streptococcal protein G domain $\beta$1. The designed proteins, named DANCERs, for dynamic and native conformational exchangers, are stably folded and switch between predicted conformational states on the millisecond timescale. The successful introduction of defined dynamics on functional timescales opens the door to new applications requiring a protein to spontaneously access multiple conformational states.},

abstract = {Allostery is a biological phenomenon of fundamental importance in regulation and signaling, and efforts to understand this process have led to the development of numerous models. In spite of individual successes in understanding the structural determinants of allostery in well-documented systems, much less success has been achieved in identifying a set of quantitative and transferable ground rules that provide an understanding of how allostery works. Are there organizing principles that allow us to relate structurally different proteins, or are the determinants of allostery unique to each system? Using an ensemble-based model, we show that allosteric phenomena can be formulated in terms of conformational free energies of the cooperative elements in a protein and the coupling interactions between them. Interestingly, the resulting allosteric ground rules provide a framework to reconcile observations that challenge purely structural models of site-to-site coupling, including (a) allostery in the absence of pathways of structural distortions, (b) allostery in the absence of any structural change, and (c) the ability of allosteric ligands to act as agonists under some circumstances and antagonists under others. The ensemble view of allostery that emerges provides insights into the energetic prerequisites of site-to-site coupling and thus into how allostery works.},

Using input data in the form of multiperspective atomic fingerprints, which describe coordination topology around unique crystallographic sites, we show that the neural-network model can be trained to effectively distinguish chemical elements based on the topology of their crystallographic environment. The model also identifies structurally similar atomic sites in the entire data set of ∼50000 crystal structures, essentially uncovering trends that reflect the periodic table of elements. The trained model was used to analyze templates derived from the known crystal structures in order to predict the likelihood of forming new compounds that could be generated by placing elements into these structural templates in a combinatorial fashion. Statistical analysis of predictive performance of the neural-network model, which was applied to a test set of structures never seen by the model during training, indicates its ability to predict known elemental compositions with a high likelihood of success. In ∼30% of cases, the known compositions were found among the top 10 most likely candidates proposed by the model. These results suggest that the approach developed in this work can be used to effectively guide the synthetic efforts in the discovery of new materials, especially in the case of systems composed of three or more chemical elements.},

Molecular dynamics (MD) is emerging as a reliable computational tool for use in conjunction with, or an alternative to, docking methods. However, simulating the protein-ligand binding process often requires very expensive simulations. This drastically limits the practical application of MD-based approaches. Here, we propose a general framework to accelerate the generation of putative protein-ligand binding modes using potential-scaled MD simulations. The proposed dynamical protocol has been applied to two pharmaceutically relevant systems (GSK-3$\beta$ and the N-terminal domain of HSP90$\alpha$). Our approach is fully independent of any predefined reaction coordinate (or collective variable). It identified the correct binding mode of several ligands and can thus save valuable computational time in dynamic docking simulations.},

abstract = {G-protein-coupled receptors comprise the largest family of mammalian transmembrane receptors. They mediate numerous cellular pathways by coupling with downstream signalling transducers, including the hetrotrimeric G proteins Gs (stimulatory) and Gi (inhibitory) and several arrestin proteins. The structural mechanisms that define how G-protein-coupled receptors selectively couple to a specific type of G protein or arrestin remain unknown. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy, we show that the major interactions between activated rhodopsin and Gi are mediated by the C-terminal helix of the Gi $\alpha$-subunit, which is wedged into the cytoplasmic cavity of the transmembrane helix bundle and directly contacts the amino terminus of helix 8 of rhodopsin. Structural comparisons of inactive, Gi-bound and arrestin-bound forms of rhodopsin with inactive and Gs-bound forms of the $\beta$2-adrenergic receptor provide a foundation to understand the unique structural signatures that are associated with the recognition of Gs, Gi and arrestin by activated G-protein-coupled receptors.},

abstract = {Phospholipase C (PLC) enzymes hydrolyze the plasma membrane (PM) lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P2) to generate the second messengers inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) in response to receptor activation in almost all mammalian cells. We previously found that stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in cardiac cells leads to the PLC-dependent hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) at the Golgi, a process required for the activation of nuclear protein kinase D (PKD) during cardiac hypertrophy. We hypothesized that GPCR-stimulated PLC activation leading to direct PI4P hydrolysis may be a general mechanism for DAG production. We measured GPCR activation-dependent changes in PM and Golgi PI4P pools in various cells using GFP-based detection of PI4P. Stimulation with various agonists caused a time-dependent reduction in PI4P-associated, but not PI4,5P2-associated, fluorescence at the Golgi and PM. Targeted depletion of PI4,5P2 from the PM before GPCR stimulation had no effect on the depletion of PM or Golgi PI4P, total inositol phosphate (IP) production, or PKD activation. In contrast, acute depletion of PI4P specifically at the PM completely blocked the GPCR-dependent production of IPs and activation of PKD but did not change the abundance of PI4,5P2 Acute depletion of Golgi PI4P had no effect on these processes. These data suggest that most of the PM PI4,5P2 pool is not involved in GPCR-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and that PI4P at the PM is responsible for the bulk of receptor-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and DAG production.},

abstract = {Several dozen signaling proteins are now known to contain 80-100 residue repeats, called PDZ (or DHR or GLGF) domains, several of which interact with the C-terminal tetrapeptide motifs X-Ser/Thr-X-Val-COO- of ion channels and/or receptors. PDZ domains have previously been noted only in mammals, flies, and worms, suggesting that the primordial PDZ domain arose relatively late in eukaryotic evolution. Here, techniques of sequence analysis-including local alignment, profile, and motif database searches-indicate that PDZ domain homologues are present in yeast, plants, and bacteria. It is suggested that two PDZ domains occur in bacterial high-temperature requirement A (htrA) and one in tail-specific protease (tsp) homologues, and that a yeast htrA homologue contains four PDZ domains. Sequence comparisons suggest that the spread of PDZ domains in these diverse organisms may have occurred via horizontal gene transfer. The known affinity of Escherichia coli tsp for C-terminal polypeptides is proposed to be mediated by its PDZ-like domain, in a similar manner to the binding of C-terminal polypeptides by animal PDZ domains.},

abstract = {The ability to predict the mechanisms and the associated rate constants of protein-ligand unbinding is of great practical importance in drug design. In this work we demonstrate how a recently introduced metadynamics-based approach allows exploration of the unbinding pathways, estimation of the rates, and determination of the rate-limiting steps in the paradigmatic case of the trypsin-benzamidine system. Protein, ligand, and solvent are described with full atomic resolution. Using metadynamics, multiple unbinding trajectories that start with the ligand in the crystallographic binding pose and end with the ligand in the fully solvated state are generated. The unbinding rate k off is computed from the mean residence time of the ligand. Using our previously computed binding affinity we also obtain the binding rate k on. Both rates are in agreement with reported experimental values. We uncover the complex pathways of unbinding trajectories and describe the critical rate-limiting steps with unprecedented detail. Our findings illuminate the role played by the coupling between subtle protein backbone fluctuations and the solvation by water molecules that enter the binding pocket and assist in the breaking of the shielded hydrogen bonds. We expect our approach to be useful in calculating rates for general protein-ligand systems and a valid support for drug design.},

abstract = {Here we develop a deep learning framework for molecular kinetics from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. There is an increasing demand for computing the relevant structures, equilibria and long-timescale kinetics of complex biomolecular processes, such as protein-drug binding, from high-throughput MD simulations. State-of-the art methods employ a handcrafted data processing pipeline, involving (i) transformation of simulated coordinates into a set of features characterizing the molecular structure, (ii) dimension reduction to collective variables, (iii) clustering the dimension-reduced data, and (iv) estimation of a Markov state model (MSM) or related model of the interconversion rates between molecular structures. This approach demands a substantial amount of modeling expertise, as poor decisions at every step will lead to large modeling errors. Here we employ the recently developed variational approach for Markov processes (VAMP) to develop a deep learning framework for molecular kinetics using neural networks, dubbed VAMPnets. A VAMPnet encodes the entire mapping from molecular coordinates to Markov states and learns optimal feature transformations, nonlinear dimension reduction, cluster discretization and MSM estimation within a single end-to-end learning framework. Our results, ranging from toy models to protein folding, are competitive or outperform state-of-the art Markov modeling methods and readily provide easily interpretable few-state kinetic models.},

Known phase-separating proteins are enriched in pi-orbital containing residues and thus we analyzed pi-interactions in folded proteins. We found that pi-pi interactions involving non-aromatic groups are widespread, underestimated by force-fields used in structure calculations and correlated with solvation and lack of regular secondary structure, properties associated with disordered regions. We present a phase separation predictive algorithm based on pi interaction frequency, highlighting proteins involved in biomaterials and RNA processing.},

abstract = {We study unbinding of multivalent cationic ligands from oppositely charged polymeric binding sites sparsely grafted on a flat neutral substrate. Our molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are suggested by single-molecule studies of protein-DNA interactions. We consider univalent salt concentrations spanning roughly a thousandfold range, together with various concentrations of excess ligands in solution. To reveal the ionic effects on unbinding kinetics of spontaneous and facilitated dissociation mechanisms, we treat electrostatic interactions both at a Debye-H\"{u}ckel (DH, or `implicit' ions, i.e., use of an electrostatic potential with a prescribed decay length) level, as well as by the more precise approach of considering all ionic species explicitly in the simulations. We find that the DH approach systematically overestimates unbinding rates, relative to the calculations where all ion pairs are present explicitly in solution, although many aspects of the two types of calculation are qualitatively similar. For facilitated dissociation (FD, acceleration of unbinding by free ligands in solution) explicit ion simulations lead to unbinding at lower free ligand concentrations. Our simulations predict a variety of FD regimes as a function of free ligand and ion concentrations; a particularly interesting regime is at intermediate concentrations of ligands where non-electrostatic binding strength controls FD. We conclude that explicit-ion electrostatic modeling is an essential component to quantitatively tackle problems in molecular ligand dissociation, including nucleic-acid-binding proteins.

We tested the method against extensive (multi $\mu$s) MD simulations of the right-handed- to left-handed-helix transition of a 9-mer peptide of AIB, the symmetry of which allows us to establish convergence. MELD-path finds all the metastable states, their correct relative populations, and the full ensemble of routes, not just a single assumed route. For this transition, we find a very broad route structure. MELD-path is highly parallelizable and efficient, yielding the full route map in a few days of computation. We believe MELD-path could be a general and rapid way to explore mechanistic processes in biomolecules on the computer.},

Until recently, KRAS had been considered undruggable with small molecules; the discovery of the covalent KRASG12C inhibitors ARS-853 and ARS-1620 has demonstrated that it is feasible to inhibit KRAS with high potency in cells and animals. Although the biological activity of these inhibitors has been described, the biochemical mechanism of how the compounds achieve potent inhibition remained incompletely understood. We now show that the activity of ARS-853 and ARS-1620 is primarily driven by KRAS-mediated catalysis of the chemical reaction with Cys12 in human KRASG12C, while the reversible binding affinity is weak, in the hundreds of micromolar or higher range. The mechanism resolves how an induced, shallow and dynamic pocket not expected to support high-affinity binding of small molecules can nevertheless be targeted with potent inhibitors and may be applicable to other targets conventionally considered undruggable.},

abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics extends classical thermodynamics to small systems in contact with one or more heat baths. It can account for the effects of thermal fluctuations and describe systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium. A basic assumption is that the expression for Shannon entropy is the appropriate description for the entropy of a nonequilibrium system in such a setting. Here we measure experimentally this function in a system that is in local but not global equilibrium. Our system is a micron-scale colloidal particle in water, in a virtual double-well potential created by a feedback trap. We measure the work to erase a fraction of a bit of information and show that it is bounded by the Shannon entropy for a two-state system. Further, by measuring directly the reversibility of slow protocols, we can distinguish unambiguously between protocols that can and cannot reach the expected thermodynamic bounds.},

abstract = {Chemical shift perturbation (CSP, chemical shift mapping or complexation-induced changes in chemical shift, CIS) follows changes in the chemical shifts of a protein when a ligand is added, and uses these to determine the location of the binding site, the affinity of the ligand, and/or possibly the structure of the complex. A key factor in determining the appearance of spectra during a titration is the exchange rate between free and bound, or more specifically the off-rate koff. When koff is greater than the chemical shift difference between free and bound, which typically equates to an affinity Kd weaker than about 3$\mu$M, then exchange is fast on the chemical shift timescale. Under these circumstances, the observed shift is the population-weighted average of free and bound, which allows Kd to be determined from measurement of peak positions, provided the measurements are made appropriately. (1)H shifts are influenced to a large extent by through-space interactions, whereas (13)C$\alpha$ and (13)C$\beta$ shifts are influenced more by through-bond effects. (15)N and (13)C' shifts are influenced both by through-bond and by through-space (hydrogen bonding) interactions. For determining the location of a bound ligand on the basis of shift change, the most appropriate method is therefore usually to measure (15)N HSQC spectra, calculate the geometrical distance moved by the peak, weighting (15)N shifts by a factor of about 0.14 compared to (1)H shifts, and select those residues for which the weighted shift change is larger than the standard deviation of the shift for all residues. Other methods are discussed, in particular the measurement of (13)CH3 signals. Slow to intermediate exchange rates lead to line broadening, and make Kd values very difficult to obtain. There is no good way to distinguish changes in chemical shift due to direct binding of the ligand from changes in chemical shift due to allosteric change. Ligand binding at multiple sites can often be characterised, by simultaneous fitting of many measured shift changes, or more simply by adding substoichiometric amounts of ligand. The chemical shift changes can be used as restraints for docking ligand onto protein. By use of quantitative calculations of ligand-induced chemical shift changes, it is becoming possible to determine not just the position but also the orientation of ligands.},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are critical regulators of human physiology and make up the largest single class of therapeutic drug targets. Although GPCRs regulate highly diverse physiology, they share a common signaling mechanism whereby extracellular stimuli induce conformational changes in the receptor that enable activation of heterotrimeric G proteins and other intracellular effectors. Advances in GPCR structural biology have made it possible to examine ligand-induced GPCR activation at an unprecedented level of detail. Here, we review the structural basis for family A GPCR activation, with a focus on GPCRs for which structures are available in both active or active-like states and inactive states. Crystallographic and other biophysical data show how chemically diverse ligands stabilize highly conserved conformational changes on the intracellular side of the receptors, allowing many different extracellular stimuli to utilize shared downstream signaling molecules. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges in understanding GPCR activation and signaling and highlight new technologies that may allow unanswered questions to be resolved.},

Markov state models offer a powerful framework for this analysis by describing a system's states and the transitions between them. A recently established variational theorem for Markov state models now enables modelers to systematically determine the best way to describe a system's dynamics. In the context of the variational theorem, we analyze ultra-long folding simulations for a canonical set of twelve proteins [K. Lindorff-Larsen et al., Science 334, 517 (2011)] by creating and evaluating many types of Markov state models. We present a set of guidelines for constructing Markov state models of protein folding; namely, we recommend the use of cross-validation and a kinetically motivated dimensionality reduction step for improved descriptions of folding dynamics. We also warn that precise kinetics predictions rely on the features chosen to describe the system and pose the description of kinetic uncertainty across ensembles of models as an open issue.},

abstract = {Proteins such as FUS phase separate to form liquid-like condensates that can harden into less dynamic structures. However, how these properties emerge from the collective interactions of many amino acids remains largely unknown. Here, we use extensive mutagenesis to identify a sequence-encoded molecular grammar underlying the driving forces of phase separation of proteins in the FUS family and test aspects of this grammar in cells. Phase separation is primarily governed by multivalent interactions among tyrosine residues from prion-like domains and arginine residues from RNA-binding domains, which are modulated by negatively charged residues. Glycine residues enhance the fluidity, whereas glutamine and serine residues promote hardening. We develop a model to show that the measured saturation concentrations of phase separation are inversely proportional to the product of the numbers of arginine and tyrosine residues. These results suggest it is possible to predict phase-separation properties based on amino acid sequences.},

abstract = {Somatic gain-of-function mutations of GNAQ and GNA11, which encode $\alpha$ subunits of heterotrimeric G$\alpha$q/11 proteins, occur in about 85% of cases of uveal melanoma (UM), the most common cancer of the adult eye. Molecular therapies to directly target these oncoproteins are lacking, and current treatment options rely on radiation, surgery, or inhibition of effector molecules downstream of these G proteins. A hallmark feature of oncogenic G$\alpha$q/11 proteins is their reduced intrinsic rate of hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which results in their accumulation in the GTP-bound, active state. Here, we report that the cyclic depsipeptide FR900359 (FR) directly interacted with GTPase-deficient G$\alpha$q/11 proteins and preferentially inhibited mitogenic ERK signaling rather than canonical phospholipase C$\beta$ (PLC$\beta$) signaling driven by these oncogenes. Thereby, FR suppressed the proliferation of melanoma cells in culture and inhibited the growth of G$\alpha$q-driven UM mouse xenografts in vivo. In contrast, FR did not affect tumor growth when xenografts carried mutated B-RafV600E as the oncogenic driver. Because FR enabled suppression of malignant traits in cancer cells that are driven by activating mutations at codon 209 in G$\alpha$q/11 proteins, we envision that similar approaches could be taken to blunt the signaling of non-G$\alpha$q/11 G proteins.},

abstract = {We have measured the activation by recombinant rhodopsin of the alpha-subunit (alpha 1) of retinal transducin (Gt, also recombinant) using a new assay. Cultured cells are transiently transfected with DNAs encoding opsin and the three subunits of Gt (alpha t, beta 1 and gamma 1). In the microsomes of these cells, incubated with 11-cis-retinal, light causes the rapid activation of Gt, as measured by the ability of GTP gamma S to protect alpha t fragments from proteolytic degradation. The activation of Gt is also observed when all-trans-retinal is added to microsomes under constant illumination. Activation depends on both opsin and retinal. Opsin mutants with known defects in activating Gt show similar defects in this assay. alpha t mutations that mimic the corresponding mutations in the alpha-subunit of Gs also produce qualitatively similar effects in this assay. As a first step in a strategy aimed at exploring the relationships between structure and function in the interactions of receptors with G proteins, we tested mutant alpha t proteins with alanine substituted for each of the 10 amino acids at the C-terminus, a region known to be crucial for interactions with rhodopsin. Alanine substitution at four positions moderately (K341) or severely (L344, G348, L349) impairs the susceptibility of alpha 1 to activation by rhodopsin. All four mutants retain their ability to be activated by AIF-4. Two other substitutions (N343 and F350) resulted in very mild defects, while substitutions at the remaining four positions (E342, K345, D346 and C347) had no effect. In combination with previous observations, these results constrain models of the interaction of the C-terminus of alpha t with rhodopsin.},

In simulations conducted with a single physics-based energy function, the proteins, representing all three major structural classes, spontaneously and repeatedly fold to their experimentally determined native structures. Early in the folding process, the protein backbone adopts a nativelike topology while certain secondary structure elements and a small number of nonlocal contacts form. In most cases, folding follows a single dominant route in which elements of the native structure appear in an order highly correlated with their propensity to form in the unfolded state.},

abstract = {Metadynamics is a computational method to explore the phase space of a molecular system. Gaussian functions are added along relevant coordinates on the fly during a molecular-dynamics simulation to force the system to escape from minima in the potential energy function. The dynamics in the resulting trajectory are however unphysical and cannot be used directly to estimate dynamical properties of the system. Girsanov reweighting is a recent method used to construct the Markov State Model (MSM) of a system subjected to an external perturbation. With the combination of these two techniques{\textemdash}metadynamics/Girsanov-reweighting{\textemdash}the unphysical dynamics in a metadynamics simulation can be reweighted to obtain the MSM of the unbiased system. We demonstrate the method on a one-dimensional diffusion process, alanine dipeptide, and the hexapeptide Val-Gly-Val-Ala-Pro-Gly (VGVAPG). The results are in excellent agreement with the MSMs obtained from direct unbiased simulations of these systems. We also apply metadynamics/...},

abstract = {The coordination of the magnesium ion in proteins by triphosphates plays an important role in catalytic hydrolysis of GTP or ATP, either in signal transduction or energy conversion. For example, in Ras the magnesium ion contributes to the catalysis of GTP hydrolysis. The cleavage of GTP to GDP and P(i) in Ras switches off cellular signaling. We analyzed GTP hydrolysis in water, Ras, and Ras{\textperiodcentered}Ras-GTPase-activating protein using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations. By comparison of the theoretical IR-difference spectra for magnesium ion coordinated triphosphate to experimental ones, the simulations are validated. We elucidated thereby how the magnesium ion contributes to catalysis. It provides a temporary storage for the electrons taken from the triphosphate and it returns them after bond cleavage and P(i) release back to the diphosphate. Furthermore, the Ras{\textperiodcentered}Mg(2+) complex forces the triphosphate into a stretched conformation in which the $\beta$- and $\gamma$-phosphates are coordinated in a bidentate manner. In this conformation, the triphosphate elongates the bond, which has to be cleaved during hydrolysis. Furthermore, the $\gamma$-phosphate adopts a more planar structure, driving the conformation of the molecule closer to the hydrolysis transition state. GTPase-activating protein enhances these changes in GTP conformation and charge distribution via the intruding arginine finger.},

abstract = {Biochemical activity and core stability are essential properties of proteins, maintained usually by conserved amino acids. Structural dynamics emerged in recent years as another essential aspect of protein functionality. Structural dynamics enable the adaptation of the protein to binding substrates and to undergo allosteric transitions, while maintaining the native fold. Key residues that mediate structural dynamics would thus be expected to be conserved or exhibit coevolutionary patterns at least. Yet, the correlation between sequence evolution and structural dynamics is yet to be established. With recent advances in efficient characterization of structural dynamics, we are now in a position to perform a systematic analysis. In the present study, a set of 34 enzymes representing various folds and functional classes is analyzed using information theory and elastic network models. Our analysis shows that the structural regions distinguished by their coevolution propensity as well as high mobility are predisposed to serve as substrate recognition sites, whereas residues acting as global hinges during collective dynamics are often supported by conserved residues. We propose a mobility scale for different types of amino acids, which tends to vary inversely with amino acid conservation. Our findings suggest the balance between physical adaptability (enabled by structure-encoded motions) and chemical specificity (conferred by correlated amino acid substitutions) underlies the selection of a relatively small set of versatile folds by proteins.},

Most of the approaches to this task, including Markov models, master-equation models, and kinetic network models, start by discretizing the high-dimensional state space and then characterize relaxation processes in terms of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a discrete transition matrix. The practical success of such an approach depends very much on the ability to finely discretize the slow order parameters. How can this task be achieved in a high-dimensional configuration space without relying on subjective guesses of the slow order parameters?

The method is illustrated by its application to the Ets-1 transcription factor, which partially unfolds upon binding DNA. The calculations show dramatic changes in the direction of information flow upon DNA binding, and elucidate how the presence of DNA is communicated from the DNA binding H1 and H3 helices to inhibitory helix HI-1.

abstract = {Exactly 50 years ago, biochemists raised the question of the mechanism of the conformational change that mediates "allosteric" interactions between regulatory sites and biologically active sites in regulatory/receptor proteins. Do the different conformations involved already exist spontaneously in the absence of the regulatory ligands (Monod-Wyman-Changeux), such that the complementary protein conformation would be selected to mediate signal transduction, or do particular ligands induce the receptor to adopt the conformation best suited to them (Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer-induced fit)? This is not just a central question for biophysics, it also has enormous importance for drug design. Recent advances in techniques have allowed detailed experimental and theoretical comparisons with the formal models of both scenarios. Also, it has been shown that mutated receptors can adopt constitutively active confirmations in the absence of ligand. There have also been demonstrations that the atomic resolution structures of the same protein are essentially the same whether ligand is bound or not. These and other advances in past decades have produced a situation where the vast majority of the data using different categories of regulatory proteins (including regulatory enzymes, ligand-gated ion channels, G protein-coupled receptors, and nuclear receptors) support the conformational selection scheme of signal transduction.},

abstract = {Conformational selection (CS) and induced fit (IF) are two widely used interpretations of binding of a ligand to biological macromolecules. Both mechanisms envision a two-step reaction in which a conformational transition either precedes (CS) or follows (IF) the binding step. Under pseudo-first-order conditions where the ligand is in excess compared to the macromolecule, both mechanisms produce two relaxations. A fast one eventually increases linearly with ligand concentration and reflects the binding interaction. A slow one saturates to a constant value after decreasing or increasing hyperbolically with ligand concentration. This relaxation is the one most often accessible to experimental measurements and is potentially diagnostic of the mechanism involved. A relaxation that decreases unequivocally identifies CS, but a hyperbolic increase is compatible with both CS and IF. The potential ambiguity between the two mechanisms is more than qualitative. Here we show that the entire kinetic repertoire of IF is nothing but a mathematical special case of CS as revealed by a simple transformation of the rate constants, which emphasizes the need for independent support of either mechanism from additional experimental evidence. We discuss a simple strategy for distinguishing between IF and CS under the most common conditions encountered in practice, i.e., when the ligand is in excess compared to the macromolecule and a single relaxation is accessible to experimental measurements.},

abstract = {1H-15N NMR spin relaxation and relaxation dispersion experiments can reveal the time scale and extent of protein motions across the ps-ms range, where the ps-ns dynamics revealed by fundamental quantities R1, R2, and heteronuclear NOE can be well-sampled by molecular dynamics simulations (MD). Although the principles of relaxation prediction from simulations are well-established, numerous NMR-MD comparisons have hitherto focused upon the aspect of order parameters S2 due to common artifacts in the prediction of transient dynamics. We therefore summarize here all necessary components and highlight existing and proposed solutions, such as the inclusion of quantum mechanical zero-point vibrational corrections and separate MD convergence of global and local motions in coarse-grained and all-atom force fields, respectively. For the accuracy of the MD prediction to be tested, two model proteins GB3 and Ubiquitin are used to validate five atomistic force fields against published NMR data supplemented by the coarse-grained force field MARTINI+EN. In Amber and CHARMM-type force fields, quantitative agreement was achieved for structured elements with minimum adjustment of global parameters. Deviations from experiment occur in flexible loops and termini, indicating differences in both the extent and time scale of backbone motions. The lack of systematic patterns and water model dependence suggests that modeling of the local environment limits prediction accuracy. Nevertheless, qualitative accuracy in a 2 $\mu$s CHARMM36m Stam2 VHS domain simulation demonstrates the potential of MD-based interpretation in combination with NMR-measured dynamics, increasing the utility of spin relaxation in integrative structural biology.},

abstract = {<p>Accurate prediction of protein structure is one of the central challenges of biochemistry. Despite significant progress made by co-evolution methods to predict protein structure from signatures of residue-residue coupling found in the evolutionary record, a direct and explicit mapping between protein sequence and structure remains elusive, with no substantial recent progress. Meanwhile, rapid developments in deep learning, which have found remarkable success in computer vision, natural language processing, and quantum chemistry raise the question of whether a deep learning based approach to protein structure could yield similar advancements. A key ingredient of the success of deep learning is the reformulation of complex, human-designed, multi-stage pipelines with differentiable models that can be jointly optimized end-to-end. We report the development of such a model, which reformulates the entire structure prediction pipeline using differentiable primitives. Achieving this required combining four technical ideas: (1) the adoption of a recurrent neural architecture to encode the internal representation of protein sequence, (2) the parameterization of (local) protein structure by torsional angles, which provides a way to reason over protein conformations without violating the covalent chemistry of protein chains, (3) the coupling of local protein structure to its global representation via recurrent geometric units, and (4) the use of a differentiable loss function to capture deviations between predicted and experimental structures. To our knowledge this is the first end-to-end differentiable model for learning of protein structure. We test the effectiveness of this approach using two challenging tasks: the prediction of novel protein folds without the use of co-evolutionary information, and the prediction of known protein folds without the use of structural templates. On the first task the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, even when compared to methods that rely on co-evolutionary data. On the second task the model is competitive with methods that use experimental protein structures as templates, achieving 3-7{\AA} accuracy despite being template-free. Beyond protein structure prediction, end-to-end differentiable models of proteins represent a new paradigm for learning and modeling protein structure, with potential applications in docking, molecular dynamics, and protein design.</p>},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can be differentially activated by ligands to generate multiple and distinct downstream signaling profiles, a phenomenon termed biased agonism. The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is a class B GPCR and a key drug target for managing metabolic disorders; however, its peptide agonists display biased signaling that affects their relative efficacies. In this study, we combined mutagenesis experiments and mapping of surface mutations onto recently described GLP-1R structures, which revealed two major domains in the GLP-1/GLP-1R/Gs protein active structure that are differentially important for both receptor quiescence and ligand-specific initiation and propagation of biased agonism. Changes to the conformation of transmembrane helix (TM) 5 and TM 6 and reordering of extracellular loop 2 were essential for the propagation of signaling linked to cAMP formation and intracellular calcium mobilization, whereas ordering and packing of residues in TMs 1 and 7 were critical for extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (pERK) activity. On the basis of these findings, we propose a model of distinct peptide-receptor interactions that selectively control how these different signaling pathways are engaged. This work provides important structural insight into class B GPCR activation and biased agonism.},

Despite the availability of a large number of X-ray structures, the mechanism of GDP release out of heterotrimeric G-proteins still remains unknown at the molecular level. Starting from the available X-ray structure, extensive unconstrained/constrained molecular dynamics simulations were performed on the complete membrane-anchored Gi heterotrimer complexed to GDP, for a total simulation time overcoming 500 ns. By combining Targeted Molecular Dynamics (TMD) and free energy profiles reconstruction by umbrella sampling, our data suggest that the release of GDP was much more favored on its phosphate side. Interestingly, upon the forced extraction of GDP on this side, the whole protein encountered large, collective motions in perfect agreement with those we described previously including a domain to domain motion between the two ras-like and helical sub-domains of G($\alpha$).},

abstract = {A new approach for efficiently exploring the configuration space and computing the free energy of large atomic and molecular systems is proposed, motivated by an analogy with reinforcement learning. There are two major components in this new approach. Like metadynamics, it allows for an efficient exploration of the configuration space by adding an adaptively computed biasing potential to the original dynamics. Like deep reinforcement learning, this biasing potential is trained on the fly using deep neural networks, with data collected judiciously from the exploration and an uncertainty indicator from the neural network model playing the role of the reward function. Parameterization using neural networks makes it feasible to handle cases with a large set of collective variables. This has the potential advantage that selecting precisely the right set of collective variables has now become less critical for capturing the structural transformations of the system. The method is illustrated by studying the full-atom explicit solvent models of alanine dipeptide and tripeptide, as well as the system of a polyalanine-10 molecule with 20 collective variables.},

Ensuring though that these two criteria are met may not always be simple. Here we build on the fact that the times of escape from a long-lived metastable state obey Poisson statistics.

abstract = {Protein kinases are dynamically regulated signaling proteins that act as switches in the cell by phosphorylating target proteins. To establish a framework for analyzing linkages between structure, function, dynamics, and allostery in protein kinases, we carried out multiple microsecond-scale molecular-dynamics simulations of protein kinase A (PKA), an exemplar active kinase. We identified residue-residue correlated motions based on the concept of mutual information and used the Girvan-Newman method to partition PKA into structurally contiguous "communities." Most of these communities included 40-60 residues and were associated with a particular protein kinase function or a regulatory mechanism, and well-known motifs based on sequence and secondary structure were often split into different communities. The observed community maps were sensitive to the presence of different ligands and provide a new framework for interpreting long-distance allosteric coupling. Communication between different communities was also in agreement with the previously defined architecture of the protein kinase core based on the "hydrophobic spine" network. This finding gives us confidence in suggesting that community analyses can be used for other protein kinases and will provide an efficient tool for structural biologists. The communities also allow us to think about allosteric consequences of mutations that are linked to disease.},

abstract = {We present two classes of improved estimators for mutual information M(X,Y), from samples of random points distributed according to some joint probability density mu(x,y). In contrast to conventional estimators based on binnings, they are based on entropy estimates from k -nearest neighbor distances. This means that they are data efficient (with k=1 we resolve structures down to the smallest possible scales), adaptive (the resolution is higher where data are more numerous), and have minimal bias. Indeed, the bias of the underlying entropy estimates is mainly due to nonuniformity of the density at the smallest resolved scale, giving typically systematic errors which scale as functions of k/N for N points. Numerically, we find that both families become exact for independent distributions, i.e. the estimator M(X,Y) vanishes (up to statistical fluctuations) if mu(x,y)=mu(x)mu(y). This holds for all tested marginal distributions and for all dimensions of x and y. In addition, we give estimators for redundancies between more than two random variables. We compare our algorithms in detail with existing algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our estimators for assessing the actual independence of components obtained from independent component analysis (ICA), for improving ICA, and for estimating the reliability of blind source separation.},

abstract = {Allostery enables tight regulation of protein function in the cellular environment. Although existing models of allostery are firmly rooted in the current structure-function paradigm, the mechanistic basis for allostery in the absence of structural change remains unclear. In this study, we show that a typical globular protein is able to undergo significant changes in volume under native conditions while exhibiting no additional changes in protein structure. These native state volume fluctuations were found to correlate with changes in internal motions that were previously recognized as a source of allosteric entropy. This finding offers a novel mechanistic basis for allostery in the absence of canonical structural change. The unexpected observation that function can be derived from expanded, low density protein states has broad implications for our understanding of allostery and suggests that the general concept of the native state be expanded to allow for more variable physical dimensions with looser packing.},

abstract = {Transcription factors and other allosteric cell signaling proteins contain a disproportionate number of domains or segments that are intrinsically disordered (ID) under native conditions. In many cases folding of these segments is coupled to binding with one or more of their interaction partners, suggesting that intrinsic disorder plays an important functional role. Despite numerous hypotheses for the role of ID domains in regulation, a mechanistic model has yet to be established that can quantitatively assess the importance of intrinsic disorder for intramolecular site-to-site communication, the hallmark property of allosteric proteins. Here, we present such a model and show that site-to-site allosteric coupling is maximized when intrinsic disorder is present in the domains or segments containing one or both of the coupled binding sites. This result not only explains the prevalence of ID domains in regulatory proteins, it also calls into question the classical mechanical view of energy propagation in proteins, which predicts that site-to-site coupling would be maximized when a well defined pathway of folded structure connects the two sites. Furthermore, in showing that the coupling mechanism conferred by intrinsic disorder is robust and independent of the network of interactions that physically link the coupled sites, unique insights are gained into the energetic ground rules that govern site-to-site communication in all proteins.},

abstract = {GPCRs catalyze GDP/GTP exchange in the $\alpha$-subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins (G$\alpha${\ss}$\gamma$) through displacement of the G$\alpha$ C-terminal $\alpha$5 helix, which directly connects the interface of the active receptor (R*) to the nucleotide binding pocket of G. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and kinetic analysis of R* catalysed G protein activation have suggested that displacement of $\alpha$5 starts from an intermediate GDP bound complex (R*{\textbullet}GGDP). To elucidate the structural basis of receptor-catalysed displacement of $\alpha$5, we modelled the structure of R*{\textbullet}GGDP. A flexible docking protocol yielded an intermediate R*{\textbullet}GGDP complex, with a similar overall arrangement as in the X-ray structure of the nucleotide free complex (R*{\textbullet}Gempty), however with the $\alpha$5 C-terminus (G$\alpha$CT) forming different polar contacts with R*. Starting molecular dynamics simulations of G$\alpha$CT bound to R* in the intermediate position, we observe a screw-like motion, which restores the specific interactions of $\alpha$5 with R* in R*{\textbullet}Gempty. The observed rotation of $\alpha$5 by 60{\textdegree} is in line with experimental data. Reformation of hydrogen bonds, water expulsion and formation of hydrophobic interactions are driving forces of the $\alpha$5 displacement. We conclude that the identified interactions between R* and G protein define a structural framework in which the $\alpha$5 displacement promotes direct transmission of the signal from R* to the GDP binding pocket.},

abstract = {Markov state models (MSMs) are a powerful framework for the analysis of molecular dynamics data sets, such as protein folding simulations, because of their straightforward construction and statistical rigor. The coarse-graining of MSMs into an interpretable number of macrostates is a crucial step for connecting theoretical results with experimental observables. Here we present the minimum variance clustering approach (MVCA) for the coarse-graining of MSMs into macrostate models. The method utilizes agglomerative clustering with Ward's minimum variance objective function, and the similarity of the microstate dynamics is determined using the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the corresponding rows in the MSM transition probability matrix. We first show that MVCA produces intuitive results for a simple tripeptide system and is robust toward long-duration statistical artifacts. MVCA is then applied to two protein folding simulations of the same protein in different force fields to demonstrate that a different number of macrostates is appropriate for each model, revealing a misfolded state present in only one of the simulations. Finally, we show that the same method can be used to analyze a data set containing many MSMs from simulations in different force fields by aggregating them into groups and quantifying their dynamical similarity in the context of force field parameter choices. The minimum variance clustering approach with the Jensen-Shannon divergence provides a powerful tool to group dynamics by similarity, both among model states and among dynamical models themselves.},

However, their usefulness is often limited by the fact that many systems are characterized by several metastable states separated by high barriers, leading to kinetic bottlenecks. Transitions between metastable states are thus rare events that occur on significantly longer timescales than one can simulate in practice. Numerous enhanced sampling methods have been introduced to alleviate this timescale problem, including methods based on identifying a few crucial order parameters or collective variables and enhancing the sampling of these variables. Metadynamics is one such method that has proven successful in a great variety of fields. Here we review the conceptual and theoretical foundations of metadynamics. As demonstrated, metadynamics is not just a practical tool but can also be considered an important development in the theory of statistical mechanics.},

abstract = {Ligand (un)binding kinetics is being recognized as a determinant of drug specificity and efficacy in an increasing number of systems. However, the calculation of kinetics and the simulation of drug unbinding is more difficult than computing thermodynamic quantities, such as binding free energies. Here we present the first full simulations of an unbinding process at pharmacologically relevant time scales (11 min), without the use of biasing forces, detailed prior knowledge, or specialized processors using the weighted ensemble based algorithm, WExplore. These simulations show the inhibitor TPPU unbinding from its enzyme target soluble epoxide hydrolase, which is a clinically relevant target that has attracted interest in kinetics optimization in order to increase efficacy. We make use of conformation space networks that allow us to conceptualize unbinding not just as a linear process, but as a network of interconnected states that connect the bound and unbound states. This allows us to visualize patterns in hydrogen-bonding, solvation, and nonequilibrium free energies, without projection onto progress coordinates. The topology and layout of the network reveal multiple unbinding pathways, and other rare events, such as the reversal of ligand orientation within the binding site. Furthermore, we make a prediction of the transition state ensemble, using transition path theory, and identify protein-ligand interactions which are stabilizing to the transition state. Additionally, we uncover trends in ligand and binding site solvation that corroborate experimental evidence from more classical structure kinetics relationships and generate new questions as to the role of drug modifications in kinetics optimization. Finally, from only 6 $\mu$s of simulation time we observed 75 unbinding events from which we calculate a residence time of 42 s, and a standard error range of 23 to 280 s. This nearly encompasses the experimental residence time 11 min (660 s). In addition to the insights to sEH inhibitor unbinding, this study shows that simulations of complex processes on timescales as long as minutes are becoming feasible for more researchers to perform.},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent the largest family of cell surface receptors regulating many human and animal physiological functions. Their implication in human pathophysiology is obvious with almost 30-40% medical drugs commercialized today directly targeting GPCRs as molecular entities. However, upon ligand binding GPCRs signal inside the cell through many key signaling, adaptor and regulatory proteins, including various classes of heterotrimeric G proteins. Therefore, G proteins are considered interesting targets for the development of pharmacological tools that are able to modulate their interaction with the receptors, as well as their activation/deactivation processes. In this review, old attempts and recent advances in the development of small molecules that directly target G proteins will be described with an emphasis on their utilization as pharmacological tools to dissect the mechanisms of activation of GPCR-G protein complexes. These molecules constitute a further asset for research in the "hot" areas of GPCR biology, areas such as multiple G protein coupling/signaling, GPCR-G protein preassembly, and GPCR functional selectivity or bias. Moreover, this review gives a particular focus on studies in vitro and in vivo supporting the potential applications of such small molecules in various GPCR/G protein-related diseases.},

To narrow the gap between chemoinformatics and biology, we have developed a suite of ligand annotation, purchasability, target, and biology association tools, incorporated into ZINC and meant for investigators who are not computer specialists. The new version contains over 120 million purchasable "drug-like" compounds--effectively all organic molecules that are for sale--a quarter of which are available for immediate delivery. ZINC connects purchasable compounds to high-value ones such as metabolites, drugs, natural products, and annotated compounds from the literature. Compounds may be accessed by the genes for which they are annotated as well as the major and minor target classes to which those genes belong. It offers new analysis tools that are easy for nonspecialists yet with few limitations for experts. ZINC retains its original 3D roots--all molecules are available in biologically relevant, ready-to-dock formats. ZINC is freely available at http://zinc15.docking.org.},

However, BRAF and NRAS mutations are absent in a number of other melanocytic neoplasms in which the equivalent oncogenic events are currently unknown. Here we report frequent somatic mutations in the heterotrimeric G protein alpha-subunit, GNAQ, in blue naevi (83%) and ocular melanoma of the uvea (46%). The mutations occur exclusively in codon 209 in the Ras-like domain and result in constitutive activation, turning GNAQ into a dominant acting oncogene. Our results demonstrate an alternative route to MAP kinase activation in melanocytic neoplasia, providing new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.},

For each pair of correlated residues, the method quantifies which residue drives the correlated motions, and which residue responds. The measure reveals how correlated motions are used to transmit information through the system, and helps to clarify the link between correlated motions and biological function in biomolecular systems. The method is illustrated by its application to the Ets-1 transcription factor, which partially unfolds upon binding DNA. The calculations show dramatic changes in the direction of information flow upon DNA binding, and elucidate how the presence of DNA is communicated from the DNA binding H1 and H3 helices to inhibitory helix HI-1. Helix H4 is shown to act as a relay, which is attenuated in the apo state.},

Combined with transition path theory, Markov state models can be applied to identify all pathways connecting any conformational states of interest. However, the identified pathways can be too complex to comprehend, especially for multi-body processes where numerous parallel pathways with comparable flux probability often coexist. Here, we have developed a path lumping method to group these parallel pathways into metastable path channels for analysis. We define the similarity between two pathways as the intercrossing flux between them and then apply the spectral clustering algorithm to lump these pathways into groups. We demonstrate the power of our method by applying it to two systems: a 2D-potential consisting of four metastable energy channels and the hydrophobic collapse process of two hydrophobic molecules. In both cases, our algorithm successfully reveals the metastable path channels. We expect this path lumping algorithm to be a promising tool for revealing unprecedented insights into the kinetic mechanisms of complex multi-body processes.},

[Science 338, 496 (2012).] and is reported to be "a necessary condition for causation" capable of distinguishing causality from standard correlation. We show that the relationships between CCM correlations proposed by Sugihara et al. do not, in general, agree with intuitive concepts of "driving" and as such should not be considered indicative of causality. It is shown that the fact that the CCM algorithm implies causality is a function of system parameters for simple linear and nonlinear systems. For example, in a circuit containing a single resistor and inductor, both voltage and current can be identified as the driver depending on the frequency of the source voltage. It is shown that the CCM algorithm, however, can be modified to identify relationships between pairs of time series that are consistent with intuition for the considered example systems for which CCM causality analysis provided nonintuitive driver identifications. This modification of the CCM algorithm is introduced as "pairwise asymmetric inference" (PAI) and examples of its use are presented.},

abstract = {Allosteric communication between two ligand-binding sites in a protein is a central aspect of biological regulation that remains mechanistically unclear. Here we show that perturbations in equilibrium picosecond-nanosecond motions impact zinc (Zn)-induced allosteric inhibition of DNA binding by the Zn efflux repressor CzrA (chromosomal zinc-regulated repressor). DNA binding leads to an unanticipated increase in methyl side-chain flexibility and thus stabilizes the complex entropically; Zn binding redistributes these motions, inhibiting formation of the DNA complex by restricting coupled fast motions and concerted slower motions. Allosterically impaired CzrA mutants are characterized by distinct nonnative fast internal dynamics "fingerprints" upon Zn binding, and DNA binding is weakly regulated. We demonstrate the predictive power of the wild-type dynamics fingerprint to identify key residues in dynamics-driven allostery. We propose that driving forces arising from dynamics can be harnessed by nature to evolve new allosteric ligand specificities in a compact molecular scaffold.},

abstract = {In chemical synthesis, the widely used Birch reduction of aromatic compounds to cyclic dienes requires alkali metals in ammonia as extremely low-potential electron donors. An analogous reaction is catalyzed by benzoyl-coenzyme A reductases (BCRs) that have a key role in the globally important bacterial degradation of aromatic compounds at anoxic sites. Because of the lack of structural information, the catalytic mechanism of enzymatic benzene ring reduction remained obscure. Here, we present the structural characterization of a dearomatizing BCR containing an unprecedented tungsten cofactor that transfers electrons to the benzene ring in an aprotic cavity. Substrate binding induces proton transfer from the bulk solvent to the active site by expelling a Zn(2+) that is crucial for active site encapsulation. Our results shed light on the structural basis of an electron transfer process at the negative redox potential limit in biology. They open the door for biological or biomimetic alternatives to a basic chemical synthetic tool.},

Then we turn to the main issue: the prediction of KCMs for dynamical heterogeneities. We focus in particular on multipoint correlation functions and susceptibilities, and decoupling in the transport coefficients. Finally we discuss the recent view of KCMs as being at first order coexistence between an active and an inactive space-time phase.},

abstract = {Accurately predicting protein-ligand binding affinities is an important problem in computational chemistry since it can substantially accelerate drug discovery for virtual screening and lead optimization. We propose here a fast machine-learning approach for predicting binding affinities using state-of-the-art 3D-convolutional neural networks and compare this approach to other machine-learning and scoring methods using several diverse data sets. The results for the standard PDBbind (v.2016) core test-set are state-of-the-art with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.82 and a RMSE of 1.27 in pK units between experimental and predicted affinity, but accuracy is still very sensitive to the specific protein used. KDEEP is made available via PlayMolecule.org for users to test easily their own protein-ligand complexes, with each prediction taking a fraction of a second. We believe that the speed, performance, and ease of use of KDEEP makes it already an attractive scoring function for modern computational chemistry pipelines.},

abstract = {Agonist-bound heptahelical receptors activate heterotrimeric G proteins by catalyzing exchange of GDP for GTP on their alpha subunits. In search of an approximation of the receptor-alpha subunit complex, we have considered the properties of A326S Gialpha1, a mutation discovered originally in Gsalpha (Iiri, T., Herzmark, P., Nakamoto, J. M., Van Dop, C., and Bourne, H. R. (1994) Nature 371, 164-168) that mimics the effect of receptor on nucleotide exchange. The mutation accelerates dissociation of GDP from the alphai1beta1gamma2 heterotrimer by 250-fold. Nevertheless, affinity of mutant Gialpha1 for GTPgammaS is high in the presence of Mg2+, and the mutation has no effect on the intrinsic GTPase activity of the alpha subunit. The mutation also uncouples two activities of betagamma: stabilization of the GDP-bound alpha subunit (which is retained) and retardation of GDP dissociation from the heterotrimer (which is lost). For wild-type and mutant Gialpha1, beta gamma prevents irreversible inactivation of the alpha subunit at 30 degreesC. However, the mutation accelerates irreversible inactivation of alpha at 37 degreesC despite the presence of beta gamma. Structurally, the mutation weakens affinity for GTPgammaS by steric crowding: a 2-fold increase in the number of close contacts between the protein and the purine ring of the nucleotide. By contrast, we observe no differences in structure at the GDP binding site between wild-type heterotrimers and those containing A326S Gialpha1. However, the GDP binding site is only partially occupied in crystals of G protein heterotrimers containing A326S Gialpha1. In contrast to original speculations about the structural correlates of receptor-catalyzed nucleotide exchange, rapid dissociation of GDP can be observed in the absence of substantial structural alteration of a Galpha subunit in the GDP-bound state.},

The electroneutral Na+/H+ antiporter NhaP from archaea Pyrococcus abyssi (PaNhaP) is a functional homolog of the human Na+/H+ exchanger NHE1, which is an important drug target. Here we resolve the Na+ and H+ transport cycle of PaNhaP by transition-path sampling. The resulting molecular dynamics trajectories of repeated ion transport events proceed without bias force, and overcome the enormous time-scale gap between seconds-scale ion exchange and microseconds simulations. The simulations reveal a hydrophobic gate to the extracellular side that opens and closes in response to the transporter domain motion. Weakening the gate by mutagenesis makes the transporter faster, suggesting that the gate balances competing demands of fidelity and efficiency. Transition-path sampling and a committor-based reaction coordinate optimization identify the essential motions and interactions that realize conformational alternation between the two access states in transporter function.},

abstract = {Simulating nucleation of molecular crystals is extremely challenging for all but the simplest cases. The challenge lies in formulating effective order parameters that are capable of driving the transition process. In recent years, order parameters based on molecular pair-functions have been successfully used in combination with enhanced sampling techniques to simulate nucleation of simple molecular crystals. However, despite the success of these approaches, we demonstrate that they can fail when applied to more complex cases. In fact, we show that order parameters based on molecular pair-functions, while successful at nucleating benzene, fail for paracetamol. Hence, we introduce a novel approach to formulate order parameters. In our approach, we construct reduced dimensional distributions of relevant quantities on the fly and then quantify the difference between these distributions and selected reference distributions. By computing the distribution of different quantities and by choosing different reference distributions, it is possible to systematically construct an effective set of order parameters. We then show that our new order parameters are capable of driving the nucleation of ordered states and, in particular, the form I crystal of paracetamol.},

In vivo, folding can begin cotranslationally and protein quality control at the ribosome is essential for cellular proteostasis. We directly characterize and compare the refolding and cotranslational folding trajectories of the protein HaloTag. We introduce new techniques for both measuring folding kinetics and detecting the conformations of partially folded intermediates during translation in real time. We find that, although translation does not affect the rate-limiting step of HaloTag folding, a key aggregation-prone intermediate observed during in vitro refolding experiments is no longer detectable. This rerouting of the folding pathway increases HaloTag{\textquoteright}s folding efficiency and may serve as a general chaperone-independent mechanism of quality control by the ribosome.</p>},

Upon activation of the Galpha subunit by binding of GTP, the Galpha and Gbetagamma subunits dissociate and interact with effector proteins for signal transduction. Regulatory proteins with the 19-amino-acid GoLoco motif can bind to Galpha subunits and maintain G-protein subunit dissociation in the absence of Galpha activation. Here we describe the structural determinants of GoLoco activity as revealed by the crystal structure of Galpha(i1) GDP bound to the GoLoco region of the 'regulator of G-protein signalling' protein RGS14. Key contacts are described between the GoLoco motif and Galpha protein, including the extension of GoLoco's highly conserved Asp/Glu-Gln-Arg triad into the nucleotide-binding pocket of Galpha to make direct contact with the GDP alpha- and beta-phosphates. The structural organization of the GoLoco Galpha(i1) complex, when combined with supporting data from domain-swapping experiments, suggests that the Galpha all-helical domain and GoLoco-region carboxy-terminal residues control the specificity of GoLoco Galpha interactions.},

abstract = {Molecular recognition by proteins is fundamental to molecular biology. Dissection of the thermodynamic energy terms governing protein-ligand interactions has proven difficult, with determination of entropic contributions being particularly elusive. NMR relaxation measurements have suggested that changes in protein conformational entropy can be quantitatively obtained through a dynamical proxy, but the generality of this relationship has not been shown. Twenty-eight protein-ligand complexes are used to show a quantitative relationship between measures of fast side-chain motion and the underlying conformational entropy. We find that the contribution of conformational entropy can range from favorable to unfavorable, which demonstrates the potential of this thermodynamic variable to modulate protein-ligand interactions. For about one-quarter of these complexes, the absence of conformational entropy would render the resulting affinity biologically meaningless. The dynamical proxy for conformational entropy or "entropy meter" also allows for refinement of the contributions of solvent entropy and the loss in rotational-translational entropy accompanying formation of high-affinity complexes. Furthermore, structure-based application of the approach can also provide insight into long-lived specific water-protein interactions that escape the generic treatments of solvent entropy based simply on changes in accessible surface area. These results provide a comprehensive and unified view of the general role of entropy in high-affinity molecular recognition by proteins.},

abstract = {Despite intense interest in discovering drugs that cause G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to selectively stimulate or block arrestin signalling, the structural mechanism of receptor-mediated arrestin activation remains unclear1,2. Here we reveal this mechanism through extensive atomic-level simulations of arrestin. We find that the receptor's transmembrane core and cytoplasmic tail-which bind distinct surfaces on arrestin-can each independently stimulate arrestin activation. We confirm this unanticipated role of the receptor core, and the allosteric coupling between these distant surfaces of arrestin, using site-directed fluorescence spectroscopy. The effect of the receptor core on arrestin conformation is mediated primarily by interactions of the intracellular loops of the receptor with the arrestin body, rather than the marked finger-loop rearrangement that is observed upon receptor binding. In the absence of a receptor, arrestin frequently adopts active conformations when its own C-terminal tail is disengaged, which may explain why certain arrestins remain active long after receptor dissociation.

Although early force field development was limited by the lack of direct comparisons between simulation and experiment, recent work from several laboratories has demonstrated direct calculation of NMR observables from protein simulations. Here, we quantitatively evaluate 11 recent molecular dynamics force fields in combination with 5 solvent models against a suite of 524 chemical shift and J coupling (3JHNH$\alpha$, 3JHNC$\beta$, 3JH$\alpha$C{\textasciiacute}, 3JHNC{\textasciiacute}, and 3JH$\alpha$N) measurements on dipeptides, tripeptides, tetra-alanine, and ubiquitin.

abstract = {K-Ras is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancers, but there are still no drugs that directly target it in the clinic. Recent studies utilizing dynamics information show promising results for selectively targeting mutant K-Ras. However, despite extensive characterization, the mechanisms by which K-Ras residue fluctuations transfer allosteric regulatory information remain unknown. Understanding the direction of information flow can provide new mechanistic insights for K-Ras targeting. Here, we present a novel approach -conditional time-delayed correlations (CTC) - using the motions of all residue pairs of a protein to predict directionality in the allosteric regulation of the protein fluctuations. Analyzing nucleotide-dependent intrinsic K-Ras motions with the new approach yields predictions that agree with the literature, showing that GTP-binding stabilizes K-Ras motions and leads to residue correlations with relatively long characteristic decay times. Furthermore, our study is the first to identify driver-follower relationships in correlated motions of K-Ras residue pairs, revealing the direction of information flow during allosteric modulation of its nucleotide-dependent intrinsic activity: active K-Ras Switch-II region motions drive Switch-I region motions, while $\alpha$-helix-3L7 motions control both. Our results provide novel insights for strategies that directly target mutant K-Ras.},

These responses can be highly dynamic, but how the information is encoded in these dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the dynamic encoding of information in the ATP-induced calcium responses of fibroblast cells, using a vectorial, or multi-time-point, measure from information theory. We find that the amount of extracted information depends on physiological constraints such as the sampling rate and memory capacity of the downstream network, and it is affected differentially by intrinsic versus extrinsic noise. By comparing to a minimal physical model, we find, surprisingly, that the information is often insensitive to the detailed structure of the underlying dynamics, and instead the decoding mechanism acts as a simple low-pass filter. These results demonstrate the mechanisms and limitations of dynamic information storage in cells.},

We have generated knockin mice harboring the point mutationGNA11c.C178T (p.Arg60Cys) identified in ADH2 patients. The mutant mice faithfully replicated human ADH2.

Instead, the configurational entropy of a query fold is estimated by evaluating an artificial neural network which was trained on molecular-dynamics simulations of about 1000 proteins. The predicted entropy can be incorporated into a large class of protein software based on cost-function minimization/evaluation in which configurational entropy is currently neglected for performance reasons. Software of this type is used for all major protein tasks such as structure predictions, proteins design, NMR and x-ray refinement, docking, and mutation effect predictions. Integrating the predicted entropy can yield a significant accuracy increase as we show exemplarily for native-state identification with the prominent protein software FoldX.

Despite the crucial role of this process in cell signaling, little is known about the mechanism of G protein activation. Here we explore the structural basis for receptor-mediated GDP release using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Binding to the activated receptor (R*) causes an apparent rigid-body movement of the alpha5 helix of G alpha that would perturb GDP binding at the beta6-alpha5 loop. This movement was not observed when a flexible loop was inserted between the alpha5 helix and the R*-binding C terminus, which uncouples R* binding from nucleotide exchange, suggesting that this movement is necessary for GDP release. These data provide the first direct observation of R*-mediated conformational changes in G proteins and define the structural basis for GDP release from G alpha.},

abstract = {It has recently become practical to construct Markov state models (MSMs) that reproduce the long-time statistical conformational dynamics of biomolecules using data from molecular dynamics simulations. MSMs can predict both stationary and kinetic quantities on long timescales (e.g. milliseconds) using a set of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations that are individually much shorter, thus addressing the well-known sampling problem in molecular dynamics simulation. In addition to providing predictive quantitative models, MSMs greatly facilitate both the extraction of insight into biomolecular mechanism (such as folding and functional dynamics) and quantitative comparison with single-molecule and ensemble kinetics experiments. A variety of methodological advances and software packages now bring the construction of these models closer to routine practice. Here, we review recent progress in this field, considering theoretical and methodological advances, new software tools, and recent applications of these approaches in several domains of biochemistry and biophysics, commenting on remaining challenges. },

abstract = {Allosteric sodium in the helix bundle of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) can modulate the receptor activation on the intracellular side. This phenomenon has confounded the GPCR community for decades. In this work, we present a theoretical model that reveals the mechanism of the allosteric modulation induced by sodium in the $\delta$-opioid receptor. We found that the allosteric sodium ion exploits a distinct conformation of the key residue Trp2746.48 to propagate the modulation to helices 5 and 6, which further transmits along the helices and regulates their positions on the intracellular side. This mechanism is supported by subsequent functional assays. Remarkably, our results highlight the contrast between the allosteric effects towards two GPCR partners, the G protein and $\beta$-arrestin, as indicated by the fact that the allosteric modulation initiated by the sodium ion significantly affects the $\beta$-arrestin recruitment, while it alters the G protein signaling only moderately. We believe that the mechanism revealed in this work can be used to explain allosteric effects initiated by sodium in other GPCRs since the allosteric sodium is highly conserved across GPCRs.},

The experimentally accessible effective rate constant for association can be decomposed in a diffusion-limited rate at which proteins come into contact and an intrinsic association rate at which the proteins in contact truly bind. Reversely, when dissociating, bound proteins first separate into a contact pair with an intrinsic dissociation rate, before moving away by diffusion. While microscopic expressions exist that enable the calculation of the intrinsic and effective rate constants by conducting a single rare event simulation of the protein dissociation reaction, these expressions are only valid when the substrate has just one binding site. If the substrate has multiple binding sites, a bound enzyme can, besides dissociating into the bulk, also hop to another binding site.

abstract = {Receptors coupled to Galpha q play a key role in the development of heart failure. Studies using genetically modified mice suggest that Galpha q mediates a hypertrophic response in cardiac myocytes. Galpha q signaling in these models is modified during early growth and development, whereas most heart failure in humans occurs after cardiac damage sustained during adulthood. To determine the phenotype of animals that express increased Galpha q signaling only as adults, we generated transgenic mice that express a silent Galpha q protein (Galpha qQ209L-hbER) in cardiac myocytes that can be activated by tamoxifen. Following drug treatment to activate Galpha q Q209L-hbER, these mice rapidly develop a dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. This phenotype does not appear to involve myocyte hypertrophy but is associated with dephosphorylation of phospholamban (PLB), decreased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase activity, and a decrease in L-type Ca2+ current density. Changes in Ca2+ handling and decreased cardiac contractility are apparent 1 week after Galpha qQ209L-hbER activation. In contrast, transgenic mice that express an inducible Galpha q mutant that cannot activate phospholipase Cbeta (PLCbeta) do not develop heart failure or changes in PLB phosphorylation, but do show decreased L-type Ca2+ current density. These results demonstrate that activation of Galpha q in cardiac myocytes of adult mice causes a dilated cardiomyopathy that requires the activation of PLCbeta. However, increased PLCbeta signaling is not required for all of the Galpha q-induced cardiac abnormalities.},

abstract = {More than two decades ago, the activation mechanism for the membrane-bound photoreceptor and prototypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) rhodopsin was uncovered. Upon light-induced changes in ligand-receptor interaction, movement of specific transmembrane helices within the receptor opens a crevice at the cytoplasmic surface, allowing for coupling of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins). The general features of this activation mechanism are conserved across the GPCR superfamily. Nevertheless, GPCRs have selectivity for distinct G-protein family members, but the mechanism of selectivity remains elusive. Structures of GPCRs in complex with the stimulatory G protein, Gs, and an accessory nanobody to stabilize the complex have been reported, providing information on the intermolecular interactions. However, to reveal the structural selectivity filters, it will be necessary to determine GPCR-G protein structures involving other G-protein subtypes. In addition, it is important to obtain structures in the absence of a nanobody that may influence the structure. Here, we present a model for a rhodopsin-G protein complex derived from intermolecular distance constraints between the activated receptor and the inhibitory G protein, Gi, using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and spin-labeling methodologies. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated the overall stability of the modeled complex. In the rhodopsin-Gicomplex, Giengages rhodopsin in a manner distinct from previous GPCR-Gsstructures, providing insight into specificity determinants.},

abstract = {Membraneless organelles, like membrane-bound organelles, are essential to cell homeostasis and provide discrete cellular subcompartments. Unlike classical organelles, membraneless organelles possess no physical barrier but rather arise by phase separation of the organelle components from the surrounding cytoplasm or nucleoplasm. Complex coacervation, the liquid-liquid phase separation of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, is one of several phenomena that are hypothesized to drive the formation and regulation of some membraneless organelles. Studies of the molecular properties of globular proteins that drive complex coacervation are limited as many proteins do not form complexes with oppositely charged macromolecules at neutral pH and moderate ionic strengths. Protein supercharging overcomes this problem and drives complexation with oppositely charged macromolecules. In this work, several distinct cationic supercharged green fluorescent protein (GFP) variants were designed to examine the phase behavior with oppositely charged polyanionic macromolecules. Cationic GFP variants phase separated with oppositely charged macromolecules at various mixing ratios, salt concentrations, and pH values. Efficient protein incorporation in the macromolecule rich phase occurred over a range of protein and polymer mass fractions, but the protein encapsulation efficiency was highest at the midpoint of the phase separation regime. More positively charged proteins phase separated over broader pH and salt ranges than those of proteins with a lower charge density. Interestingly, each GFP variant phase separated at higher salt concentrations with anionic synthetic macromolecules compared to anionic biological macromolecules. Optical microscopy revealed that most variants, depending on solution conditions, formed liquid-liquid phase separations, except for GFP/DNA pairs that formed solid aggregates under all tested conditions.},

abstract = {Many proteins exhibit a critical property called allostery, which enables intra-molecular transmission of information between distal sites. Microscopically, allosteric response is closely related to correlated atomic fluctuations. Conventional correlation analysis correlates the atomic fluctuations at two sites by taking the dot product between the fluctuations, which accounts only for the parallel and antiparallel components. Here, we present a singular value decomposition (SVD) method that analyzes the correlation coefficient of fluctuation dynamics with an arbitrary angle between the correlated directions. In a model allosteric system, the second PDZ domain (PDZ2) in the human PTP1E protein, approximately one third of the strong correlations have near-perpendicular directions, which are underestimated in the conventional method. The discrimination becomes more prominent for residue pairs with larger separation. The results of the proposed SVD method are more consistent with the experimentally determined PDZ2 dynamics than those of conventional method. In addition, the SVD method improved the prediction accuracy of the allosteric sites in a dataset of 23 known allosteric monomer proteins. The proposed method may inspire extended investigation not only into allostery, but also into protein dynamics and drug design. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this article we use all-atom simulations to elucidate the mechanisms underlying conformational switching and allostery within the coat protein of the bacteriophage MS2. Assembly of most icosahedral virus capsids requires that the capsid protein adopt different conformations at precise locations within the capsid. It has been shown that a 19 nucleotide stem loop (TR) from the MS2 genome acts as an allosteric effector, guiding conformational switching of the coat protein during capsid assembly. Since the principal conformational changes occur far from the TR binding site, it is important to understand the molecular mechanism underlying this allosteric communication. To this end, we use all-atom simulations with explicit water combined with a path sampling technique to sample the MS2 coat protein conformational transition, in the presence and absence of TR-binding. The calculations find that TR binding strongly alters the transition free energy profile, leading to a switch in the favored conformation. We discuss changes in molecular interactions responsible for this shift. We then identify networks of amino acids with correlated motions to reveal the mechanism by which effects of TR binding span the protein. The analysis predicts amino acids whose substitution by mutagenesis could alter populations of the conformational substates or their transition rates.},

Mutations that impair the GTPase activity of certain heterotrimeric signal-transducing G proteins or of p21ras cause tumors in man. A conserved glutamic residue in the alpha subunit of G proteins has been hypothesized to serve as a general base, thereby activating a water molecule for nucleophilic attack on GTP. The results of mutagenesis of this residue (Glu-207) in Gi alpha 1 refute this hypothesis. Based on the structure of the complex of Gi alpha 1 with GDP, Mg2+, and AlF-4, which appears to resemble the transition state for GTP hydrolysis, we believe that Gln-204 of Gi alpha 1, rather than Glu-207, supports catalysis of GTP hydrolysis by stabilization of the transition state.},

However, at times, searching for good collective variables can be challenging.

J. Chem. Phys. 2017 , 147 , 204109 ]. In this work, we extend these ideas to variationally enhanced sampling. This leads to an efficient scheme that is able to make use of the many advantages of the variational scheme. We apply the method to alanine-3 in water. From an alanine-3 variationally enhanced sampling trajectory in which all the six dihedral angles are biased, we extract much better collective variables able to describe in exquisite detail the protein complex free energy surface in a low dimensional representation. The success of this investigation is helped by a more accurate way of calculating the correlation functions needed in the time-lagged independent component analysis and from the introduction of a new basis set to describe the dihedral angles arrangement.},

abstract = {The iterative threading assembly refinement (I-TASSER) server is an integrated platform for automated protein structure and function prediction based on the sequence-to-structure-to-function paradigm. Starting from an amino acid sequence, I-TASSER first generates three-dimensional (3D) atomic models from multiple threading alignments and iterative structural assembly simulations. The function of the protein is then inferred by structurally matching the 3D models with other known proteins. The output from a typical server run contains full-length secondary and tertiary structure predictions, and functional annotations on ligand-binding sites, Enzyme Commission numbers and Gene Ontology terms. An estimate of accuracy of the predictions is provided based on the confidence score of the modeling. This protocol provides new insights and guidelines for designing of online server systems for the state-of-the-art protein structure and function predictions. The server is available at http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER.},

abstract = {Src kinase activity is controlled by various mechanisms involving a coordinated movement of kinase and regulatory domains. Notwithstanding the extensive knowledge related to the backbone dynamics, little is known about the more subtle side-chain dynamics within the regulatory domains and their role in the activation process. Here, we show through experimental methyl dynamic results and predicted changes in side-chain conformational couplings that the SH2 structure of Fyn contains a dynamic network capable of propagating binding information. We reveal that binding the phosphorylated tail of Fyn perturbs a residue cluster near the linker connecting the SH2 and SH3 domains of Fyn, which is known to be relevant in the regulation of the activity of Fyn. Biochemical perturbation experiments validate that those residues are essential for inhibition of Fyn, leading to a gain of function upon mutation. These findings reveal how side-chain dynamics may facilitate the allosteric regulation of the different members of the Src kinase family.},

abstract = {Enhanced sampling techniques represent a versatile approach to account for rare conformational transitions in biomolecules. A particularly promising strategy is to combine massive parallel computing of short molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories (to sample the free energy landscape of the system) with Markov state modeling (to rebuild the kinetics from the sampled data). To obtain well-distributed initial structures for the short trajectories, it is proposed to employ Metadynamics MD, which quickly sweeps through the entire free energy landscape of interest. Being only used to generate initial conformations, the implementation of Metadynamics can be simple and fast. The conformational dynamics of helical peptide Aib9 is adopted to discuss various technical issues of the approach, including Metadynamics settings, minimal number and length of short MD trajectories, as well as the validation of the resulting Markov models. Using Metadynamics to launch some thousands of nanosecond trajectories, several Markov state models are constructed which reveal that previous unbiased MD simulations of in total 16 $\mu$s length cannot provide correct equilibrium populations or qualitative features of the pathway distribution of the short peptide.},

abstract = {An increasing number of studies have reported computations of the standard (absolute) binding free energy of small ligands to proteins using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and explicit solvent molecules that are in good agreement with experiments. This encouraging progress suggests that physics-based approaches hold the promise of making important contributions to the process of drug discovery and optimization in the near future. Two types of approaches are principally used to compute binding free energies with MD simulations. The most widely known is the alchemical double decoupling method, in which the interaction of the ligand with its surroundings are progressively switched off. It is also possible to use a potential of mean force (PMF) method, in which the ligand is physically separated from the protein receptor. For both of these computational approaches, restraining potentials may be activated and released during the simulation for sampling efficiently the changes in translational, rotational, and conformational freedom of the ligand and protein upon binding. Because such restraining potentials add bias to the simulations, it is important that their effects be rigorously removed to yield a binding free energy that is properly unbiased with respect to the standard state. A review of recent results is presented, and differences in computational methods are discussed. Examples of computations with T4-lysozyme mutants, FKBP12, SH2 domain, and cytochrome P450 are discussed and compared. Remaining difficulties and challenges are highlighted.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of intra-protein communication is fundamental to such processes as allostery and signaling, yet comparatively little is understood about its physical origins despite notable progress in recent years. This review introduces contemporary but distinct frameworks for understanding intra-protein communication by presenting both the ideas behind them and a discussion of their successes and shortcomings. The first framework holds that intra-protein communication is accomplished by the sequential mechanical linkage of residues spanning a gap between distal sites. According to the second framework, proteins are best viewed as ensembles of distinct structural microstates, the dynamical and thermodynamic properties of which contribute to the experimentally observable macroscale properties. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful method for studying intra-protein communication, and the insights into both frameworks it provides are presented through a discussion of numerous examples from the literature. Distinct from mechanical and thermodynamic considerations of intra-protein communication are recently applied graph and network theoretic analyses. These computational methods reduce complex three dimensional protein architectures to simple maps comprised of nodes (residues) connected by edges (inter-residue "interactions"). Analysis of these graphs yields a characterization of the protein's topology and network characteristics. These methods have shown proteins to be "small world" networks with moderately high local residue connectivities existing concurrently with a small but significant number of long range connectivities. However, experimental studies of the tantalizing idea that these putative long range interaction pathways facilitate one or several macroscopic protein characteristics are unfortunately lacking at present. This review concludes by comparing and contrasting the presented frameworks and methodologies for studying intra-protein communication and suggests a manner in which they can be brought to bear simultaneously to further enhance our understanding of this important fundamental phenomenon.},

The switch II and switch III segments become disordered, and linker II connecting the Ras and alpha helical domains moves, thus altering the structures of potential effector and beta gamma binding regions. Contacts between the alpha-helical and Ras domains are weakened, possibly facilitating the release of guanosine diphosphate (GDP). The amino and carboxyl termini, which contain receptor and beta gamma binding determinants, are disordered in the complex with GTP, but are organized into a compact microdomain on GDP hydrolysis. The amino terminus also forms extensive quaternary contacts with neighboring alpha subunits in the lattice, suggesting that multimers of alpha subunits or heterotrimers may play a role in signal transduction.},

Here, we mutate Lys147 of the conserved (145)SAK(147) motif in the G60A background and characterize the resulting double mutant (DM). We show that RasDM is the first structure of a Ras protein with identical GDP- and GTP-bound structures. Both structures adopt the open conformation of the active form of RasG60A. The increase in the accessible surface area of the nucleotide is consistent with a 4-fold increase in its dissociation rate. Stopped-flow experiments show no major difference in the two-step kinetics of association of GDP or GTP with the wild type, G60A, or RasDM. Addition of Sos fails to accelerate nucleotide exchange. Overexpression of the G60A or double mutant of Ras in COS-1 cells fails to activate Erk and shows a strong dominant negative effect. Our data suggest that flexibility at position 60 is required for proper Sos-catalyzed nucleotide exchange and that structural information is somehow shared among the switch regions and the different nucleotide binding motifs.},

abstract = {Elucidation of the molecular details of allosteric communication between distant sites in a protein is key to understanding and manipulating many biological regulatory processes. Although protein disorder is acknowledged to play an important thermodynamic role in allostery, the molecular mechanisms by which this disorder is harnessed for long distance communication are known for a limited number of systems. Transcription repression by the E. coli biotin repressor, BirA, is allosterically activated by binding of the small molecule effector biotinoyl-5'-AMP. The effector acts by promoting BirA dimerization, which is a prerequisite to sequence-specific binding to the biotin biosynthetic operon operator sequence. A 30{\AA} distance separates the effector binding and dimerization surfaces in BirA and previous studies indicate that allostery is mediated, in part, by disorder-to-order transitions on the two-coupled sites. In this work, combined experimental and computational methods have been applied to investigate the molecular basis of allosteric communication in BirA. Double mutant cycle analysis coupled with thermodynamic measurements indicates functional coupling between residues in disordered loops on the two distant surfaces. All Atom Molecular Dynamics Simulations reveal that this coupling occurs through long-distance reciprocal modulation of the structure and dynamics of disorder-to-order transitions on the two surfaces.},

Combining deep learning and statistical mechanics, we here develop Boltzmann Generators, that are shown to generate unbiased one-shot equilibrium samples of representative condensed matter systems and proteins. Boltzmann Generators use neural networks to learn a coordinate transformation of the complex configurational equilibrium distribution to a distribution that can be easily sampled. Accurate computation of free energy differences and discovery of new configurations are demonstrated, providing a statistical mechanics tool that can avoid rare events during sampling without prior knowledge of reaction coordinates.},

abstract = {Rhodopsin is a photoactive G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that converts dim light into a signal for the brain, leading to eyesight. Full activation of this GPCR is achieved after passing through several steps of the protein's photoactivation pathway. Key events of rhodopsin activation are the initial cis-trans photoisomerization of the covalently bound retinal moiety followed by conformational rearrangements and deprotonation of the chromophore's protonated Schiff base (PSB), which ultimately lead to full activation in the meta II state. PSB deprotonation is crucial for achieving full activation of rhodopsin; however, the specific structural rearrangements that have to take place to induce this pKa shift are not well understood. Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to identify intermediate states after the cis-trans isomerization of rhodopsin's retinal moiety. In order to select the intermediate state in which PSB deprotonation is experimentally known to occur, the validity of the intermediate configurations was checked through an evaluation of the optical properties in comparison with experiment. Subsequently, the selected state was used to investigate the molecular factors that enable PSB deprotonation at body temperature to obtain a better understanding of the difference between the protonated and the deprotonated state of the chromophore. To this end, the deprotonation reaction has been investigated by applying QM/MM MD simulations in combination with thermodynamic integration. The study shows that, compared to the inactive 11-cis-retinal case, trans-retinal rhodopsin is able to undergo PSB deprotonation due to a change in the conformation of the retinal and a consequent alteration in the hydrogen-bond (HB) network in which PSB and the counterion Glu113 are embedded.

abstract = {2,4-Dienoyl-CoA reductases, enzymes of the beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids which were purified from bovine liver and oleate-induced cells of Escherichia coli, revealed very similar substrate specificities but distinctly different molecular properties. The subunit molecular weights, estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were 32,000 and 73,000 for the mammalian and the bacterial enzyme, respectively. The native molecular weights, calculated from sedimentation coefficients and Stokes radii yielded 124,000 for the bovine liver and 70,000 for the bacterial enzyme. Thus, bovine liver 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase is a tetramer consisting of four identical subunits. The E. coli 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, however, possesses a monomeric structure. The latter enzyme contains 1 mol of FAD/mol of enzyme, whereas the former reductase is not a flavoprotein. The bovine liver reductase reduced 2-trans, 4-cis- and 2-trans,4-trans-decadienoyl-CoA to 3-trans-decenoyl-CoA. The E. coli reductase catalyzed the reduction of the same two substrates but in contrast yielded 2-trans-decenoyl-CoA as reaction product. Certain other properties of the two 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductases are also presented. The localization of the reductase step within the degradation pathway of 4-cis-decenoyl-CoA, a metabolite of linoleic acid, is discussed.},

abstract = {Guanine nucleotide exchange in heterotrimeric G proteins catalyzed by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a key event in many physiological processes. The crystal structures of the GPCR rhodopsin and two G proteins as well as binding sites on both catalytically interacting proteins are known, but the temporal sequence of events leading to nucleotide exchange remains to be elucidated. We employed time-resolved near infrared light scattering to study the order in which the Galpha and Ggamma C-terminal binding sites on the holo-G protein interact with the active state of the GPCR rhodopsin (R*) in native membranes. We investigated these key binding sites within mass-tagged peptides and G proteins and found that their binding to R* is mutually exclusive. The interaction of the holo-G protein with R* requires at least one of the lipid modifications of the G protein (i.e. myristoylation of the Galpha N terminus and/or farnesylation of the Ggamma C terminus). A holo-G protein with a high affinity Galpha C terminus shows a specific change of the reaction rate in the GDP release and GTP uptake steps of catalysis. We interpret the data by a sequential fit model where (i) the initial encounter between R* and the G protein occurs with the Gbetagamma subunit, and (ii) the Galpha C-terminal tail then interacts with R* to release bound GDP, thereby decreasing the affinity of R* for the Gbetagamma subunit. The mechanism limits the time in which both C-terminal binding sites of the G protein interact simultaneously with R* to a short lived transitory state.},

abstract = {Catalysis of nucleotide exchange in heterotrimeric G proteins (Galphabetagamma) is a key step in cellular signal transduction mediated by G protein-coupled receptors. The Galpha N terminus with its helical stretch is thought to be crucial for G protein/activated receptor (R(*)) interaction. The N-terminal fatty acylation of Galpha is important for membrane targeting of G proteins. By applying biophysical techniques to the rhodopsin/transducin model system, we studied the effect of N-terminal truncations in Galpha. In Galphabetagamma, lack of the fatty acid and Galpha truncations up to 33 amino acids had little effect on R(*) binding and R(*)-catalyzed nucleotide exchange, implying that this region is not mandatory for R(*)/Galphabetagamma interaction. However, when the other hydrophobic modification of Galphabetagamma, the Ggamma C-terminal farnesyl moiety, is lacking, R(*) interaction requires the fatty acylated Galpha N terminus. This suggests that the two hydrophobic extensions can replace each other in the interaction of Galphabetagamma with R(*). We propose that in native Galphabetagamma, these two terminal regions are functionally redundant and form a microdomain that serves both to anchor the G protein to the membrane and to establish an initial docking complex with R(*). Accordingly, we find that the native fatty acylated Galpha is competent to interact with R(*) even in the absence of Gbetagamma, whereas nonacylated Galpha requires Gbetagamma for interaction. Experiments with N-terminally truncated Galpha subunits suggest that in the second step of the catalytic process, the receptor binds to the alphaN/beta1-loop region of Galpha to reduce nucleotide affinity and to make the Galpha C terminus available for subsequent interaction with R(*).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Anaerobic polycyclic hydrocarbon (PAH) degradation coupled to sulfate reduction may be an important mechanism for in situ remediation of contaminated sediments. Steps involved in the anaerobic degradation of 2-methylnaphthalene have been described in the sulfate reducing strains NaphS3, NaphS6 and N47. Evidence from N47 suggests that naphthalene degradation involves 2-methylnaphthalene as an intermediate, whereas evidence in NaphS2, NaphS3 and NaphS6 suggests a mechanism for naphthalene degradation that does not involve 2-methylnaphthalene. To further characterize pathways involved in naphthalene degradation in NaphS2, the draft genome was sequenced, and gene and protein expression examined.

RESULTS:Draft genome sequencing, gene expression analysis, and proteomic analysis revealed that NaphS2 degrades naphthoyl-CoA in a manner analogous to benzoyl-CoA degradation. Genes including the previously characterized NmsA, thought to encode an enzyme necessary for 2-methylnaphthalene metabolism, were not upregulated during growth of NaphS2 on naphthalene, nor were the corresponding protein products. NaphS2 may possess a non-classical dearomatizing enzyme for benzoate degradation, similar to one previously characterized in Geobacter metallireducens. Identification of genes involved in toluene degradation in NaphS2 led us to determine that NaphS2 degrades toluene, a previously unreported capacity. The genome sequence also suggests that NaphS2 may degrade other monoaromatic compounds.

CONCLUSION:This study demonstrates that steps leading to the degradation of 2-naphthoyl-CoA are conserved between NaphS2 and N47, however while NaphS2 possesses the capacity to degrade 2-methylnaphthalene, naphthalene degradation likely does not proceed via 2-methylnaphthalene. Instead, carboxylation or another form of activation may serve as the first step in naphthalene degradation. Degradation of toluene and 2-methylnaphthalene, and the presence of at least one bss-like and bbs-like gene cluster in this organism, suggests that NaphS2 degrades both compounds via parallel mechanisms. Elucidation of the key genes necessary for anaerobic naphthalene degradation may provide the ability to track naphthalene degradation through in situ transcript monitoring.},

The G-domain, which catalyzes GTP hydrolysis and mediates downstream signaling, is 95% conserved between the Ras isoforms. Because of their very high sequence identity, biochemical studies done on H-Ras have been considered representative of all three Ras proteins. We show here that this is not a valid assumption. Using enzyme kinetic assays under identical conditions, we observed clear differences between the three isoforms in intrinsic catalysis of GTP by Ras in the absence and presence of the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of the c-Raf kinase protein (Raf-RBD). Given their identical active sites, isoform G-domain differences must be allosteric in origin, due to remote isoform-specific residues that affect conformational states. We present the crystal structure of N-Ras bound to a GTP analogue and interpret the kinetic data in terms of structural features specific for H-, K-, and N-Ras.},

abstract = {Thymidylate is a critical DNA nucleotide that has to be synthesized in cells de novo by all organisms. Flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase (FDTS) catalyzes the final step in this de novo production of thymidylate in many human pathogens, but it is absent from humans. The FDTS reaction proceeds via a chemical route that is different from its human enzyme analogue, making FDTS a potential antimicrobial target. The chemical mechanism of FDTS is still not understood, and the two most recently proposed mechanisms involve reaction intermediates that are unusual in pyrimidine biosynthesis and biology in general. These mechanisms differ in the relative timing of the reaction of the flavin with the substrate. The consequence of this difference is significant: the intermediates are cationic in one case and neutral in the other, an important consideration in the construction of mechanism-based enzyme inhibitors. Here we test these mechanisms via chemical trapping of reaction intermediates, stopped-flow, and substrate hydrogen isotope exchange techniques. Our findings suggest that an initial activation of the pyrimidine substrate by reduced flavin is required for catalysis, and a revised mechanism is proposed on the basis of previous and new data. These findings and the newly proposed mechanism add an important piece to the puzzle of the mechanism of FDTS and suggest a new class of intermediates that, in the future, may serve as targets for mechanism-based design of FDTS-specific inhibitors.},

Here we report the structure of an agonist-bound, active state of the human M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor stabilized by a G-protein mimetic camelid antibody fragment isolated by conformational selection using yeast surface display. In addition to the expected changes in the intracellular surface, the structure reveals larger conformational changes in the extracellular region and orthosteric binding site than observed in the active states of the $\beta$2AR and rhodopsin. We also report the structure of the M2 receptor simultaneously bound to the orthosteric agonist iperoxo and the positive allosteric modulator LY2119620. This structure reveals that LY2119620 recognizes a largely pre-formed binding site in the extracellular vestibule of the iperoxo-bound receptor, inducing a slight contraction of this outer binding pocket. These structures offer important insights into the activation mechanism and allosteric modulation of muscarinic receptors.},

abstract = {Signal transduction networks allow eukaryotic cells to make decisions based on information about intracellular state and the environment. Biochemical noise significantly diminishes the fidelity of signaling: networks examined to date seem to transmit less than 1 bit of information. It is unclear how networks that control critical cell-fate decisions (e.g., cell division and apoptosis) can function with such low levels of information transfer. Here, we use theory, experiments, and numerical analysis to demonstrate an inherent trade-off between the information transferred in individual cells and the information available to control population-level responses. Noise in receptor-mediated apoptosis reduces information transfer to approximately 1 bit at the single-cell level but allows 3-4 bits of information to be transmitted at the population level. For processes such as eukaryotic chemotaxis, in which single cells are the functional unit, we find high levels of information transmission at a single-cell level. Thus, low levels of information transfer are unlikely to represent a physical limit. Instead, we propose that signaling networks exploit noise at the single-cell level to increase population-level information transfer, allowing extracellular ligands, whose levels are also subject to noise, to incrementally regulate phenotypic changes. This is particularly critical for discrete changes in fate (e.g., life vs. death) for which the key variable is the fraction of cells engaged. Our findings provide a framework for rationalizing the high levels of noise in metazoan signaling networks and have implications for the development of drugs that target these networks in the treatment of cancer and other diseases.},

abstract = {A new mechanism-based inactivator of beta-1,4-xylanases, 2',4'-dinitrophenyl 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-beta-xylobioside, has been synthesized and used to trap the covalent intermediate formed during catalysis by Bacillus subtilis xylanase. Electrospray mass spectrometry confirmed the 1:1 stoichiometry of the incorporation of inactivator into the enzyme. Inactivation of xylanase followed the expected pseudo-first-order kinetic behavior, and kinetic parameters were determined. The intermediate trapped was relatively stable toward hydrolytic turnover (t1/2 = 350 min). However, turnover could be facilitated by transglycosylation following the addition of the acceptor benzyl thio-beta-xylobioside, thus demonstrating the catalytic competence of the trapped intermediate. Reactivation kinetic parameters for this process of kre = 0.03 min-1 and Kre = 46 mM were determined. The nucleophilic amino acid was identified as Glu78 by a tandem mass spectrometric technique which does not require the use of radiolabels. The peptic digest of the labeled enzyme was separated by high-performance liquid chromatography and the eluent fed into a tandem mass spectrometer via an electrospray ionization device. The labeled peptide was identified as one of m/z = 826 (doubly charged) which fragmented in the collision chamber between the mass analyzers with loss of the mass of a 2-fluoroxylobiosyl unit. Confirmation of the peptide identity was obtained both by tandem mass spectrometric sequencing and by Edman degradation of the purified peptide. Glu78 is completely conserved in all members of this xylanase family and indeed is shown to be located in the active site in the recently determined X-ray crystal structure.},

abstract = {Heterotrimeric G proteins relay extracellular cues from heptahelical transmembrane receptors to downstream effector molecules. Composed of an alpha subunit with intrinsic GTPase activity and a betagamma heterodimer, the trimeric complex dissociates upon receptor-mediated nucleotide exchange on the alpha subunit, enabling each component to engage downstream effector targets for either activation or inhibition as dictated in a particular pathway. To mitigate excessive effector engagement and concomitant signal transmission, the Galpha subunit's intrinsic activation timer (the rate of GTP hydrolysis) is regulated spatially and temporally by a class of GTPase accelerating proteins (GAPs) known as the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) family. The array of G protein-coupled receptors, Galpha subunits, RGS proteins and downstream effectors in mammalian systems is vast. Understanding the molecular determinants of specificity is critical for a comprehensive mapping of the G protein system. Here, we present the 2.9 A crystal structure of the enigmatic, neuronal G protein Galpha(o) in the GTP hydrolytic transition state, complexed with RGS16. Comparison with the 1.89 A structure of apo-RGS16, also presented here, reveals plasticity upon Galpha(o) binding, the determinants for GAP activity, and the structurally unique features of Galpha(o) that likely distinguish it physiologically from other members of the larger Galpha(i) family, affording insight to receptor, GAP and effector specificity.},

Here, we have used mutagenesis and NMR relaxation methods to investigate the scope and nature of the communication networks found in the second post-synaptic density-95/discs large/zonula occludens-1 (PDZ) domain of the human protein tyrosine phosphatase 1E protein (hPTP1E) (PDZ2). It was found that most mutations do not have a significant energetic contribution to peptide ligand binding. Three mutants that showed significant changes in binding also displayed context-dependent dynamic effects. Both a mutation at a partially exposed site (H71Y) and a buried core position (I35V) had a limited response in side-chain (2)H-based dynamics when compared to wild-type PDZ2. In contrast, a change at a second core position (I20F) that had previously been shown to be part of an energetic and dynamic network, resulted in extensive changes in side-chain dynamics. This response is reminiscent to that seen previously upon peptide ligand binding. These results shed light on the nature of the PDZ2 dynamic network and suggest that position 20 in PDZ2 acts as a "hub" that is energetically and dynamically critical for transmitting changes in dynamics throughout the PDZ domain.},

The resulting 29-mutant variant is 1,000-fold more efficient in the synthesis of the drug simvastatin than the wild-type LovD. This is to our knowledge the first nonpatent report of the enzyme currently used for the manufacture of simvastatin as well as the intermediate evolved variants. Crystal structures and microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations revealed the mechanism by which the laboratory-generated mutations free LovD from dependence on protein-protein interactions. Mutations markedly altered conformational dynamics of the catalytic residues, obviating the need for allosteric modulation by the acyl carrier LovF.},

Here we report the structure of CAP in the absence of cAMP, which, together with structures of CAP in the presence of cAMP, defines atomic details of the cAMP-mediated allosteric transition. The structural changes, and their relationship to cAMP binding and DNA binding, are remarkably clear and simple. Binding of cAMP results in a coil-to-helix transition that extends the coiled-coil dimerization interface of CAP by 3 turns of helix and concomitantly causes rotation, by approximately 60 degrees , and translation, by approximately 7 A, of the DNA-binding domains (DBDs) of CAP, positioning the recognition helices in the DBDs in the correct orientation to interact with DNA. The allosteric transition is stabilized further by expulsion of an aromatic residue from the cAMP-binding pocket upon cAMP binding. The results define the structural mechanisms that underlie allosteric control of this prototypic transcriptional regulatory factor and provide an illustrative example of how effector-mediated structural changes can control the activity of regulatory proteins.},

abstract = {The discovery of drug-like molecules that bind pockets in proteins that are not present in crystallographic structures yet exert allosteric control over activity has generated great interest in designing pharmaceuticals that exploit allosteric effects. However, there have only been a small number of successes, so the therapeutic potential of these pockets--called hidden allosteric sites--remains unclear. One challenge for assessing their utility is that rational drug design approaches require foreknowledge of the target site, but most hidden allosteric sites are only discovered when a small molecule is found to stabilize them. We present a means of decoupling the identification of hidden allosteric sites from the discovery of drugs that bind them by drawing on new developments in Markov state modeling that provide unprecedented access to microsecond- to millisecond-timescale fluctuations of a protein's structure. Visualizing these fluctuations allows us to identify potential hidden allosteric sites, which we then test via thiol labeling experiments. Application of these methods reveals multiple hidden allosteric sites in an important antibiotic target--TEM-1 $\beta$-lactamase. This result supports the hypothesis that there are many as yet undiscovered hidden allosteric sites and suggests our methodology can identify such sites, providing a starting point for future drug design efforts. More generally, our results demonstrate the power of using Markov state models to guide experiments.},

abstract = {The role of interdomain contact sites in basal GDP release from heterotrimeric G proteins is unknown. G(alpha)(o) and G(alpha)(i1) display a 5-fold difference in the rate of GDP dissociation with half-times of 2.3 +/- 0.2 and 10.4 +/- 1.3 min, respectively. To identify molecular determinants of the GDP release rate, we evaluated the rate of binding of the fluorescent guanine nucleotide 2'(3')-O-(N-methyl-3'-anthraniloyl)guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (mGTPgammaS) to chimers of G(alpha)(o) and G(alpha)(i1). Although no one region of the G protein determined the GDP dissociation rate, when the C-terminal 123 amino acids in G(alpha)(i1) were replaced with those of G(alpha)(o), the GDP release rate increased 3.3-fold compared to that of wild-type G(alpha)(i1). Within the C-terminal portion, modification of four amino acids in a coil between beta4 and the alpha3 helix resulted in GDP release kinetics identical to those of wild-type G(alpha)(o). Based on the G(alpha)(i1)-GDP crystal structure of this region, Leu(232) appeared to form a hydrophobic contact with Arg(144) of the helical domain. The role of this interaction was confirmed by G(alpha)(i1) L232Q and G(alpha)(i1) R144A which displayed 2-5-fold faster GDP release rates compared to wild-type G(alpha)(i1) (t(1/2) 4.7 and 1.5 min, respectively), suggesting that interdomain bridging contacts partially determine the basal rate of GDP release from heterotrimeric G proteins.},

abstract = {Protein folding is a fundamental process in biology, key to understanding many human diseases. Experimentally, proteins often appear to fold via simple two- or three-state mechanisms involving mainly native-state interactions, yet recent network models built from atomistic simulations of small proteins suggest the existence of many possible metastable states and folding pathways. We reconcile these two pictures in a combined experimental and simulation study of acyl-coenzyme A binding protein (ACBP), a two-state folder (folding time {\textasciitilde}10 ms) exhibiting residual unfolded-state structure, and a putative early folding intermediate. Using single-molecule FRET in conjunction with side-chain mutagenesis, we first demonstrate that the denatured state of ACBP at near-zero denaturant is unusually compact and enriched in long-range structure that can be perturbed by discrete hydrophobic core mutations. We then employ ultrafast laminar-flow mixing experiments to study the folding kinetics of ACBP on the microsecond time scale. These studies, along with Trp-Cys quenching measurements of unfolded-state dynamics, suggest that unfolded-state structure forms on a surprisingly slow ({\textasciitilde}100 $\mu$s) time scale, and that sequence mutations strikingly perturb both time-resolved and equilibrium smFRET measurements in a similar way. A Markov state model (MSM) of the ACBP folding reaction, constructed from over 30 ms of molecular dynamics trajectory data, predicts a complex network of metastable stables, residual unfolded-state structure, and kinetics consistent with experiment but no well-defined intermediate preceding the main folding barrier. Taken together, these experimental and simulation results suggest that the previously characterized fast kinetic phase is not due to formation of a barrier-limited intermediate but rather to a more heterogeneous and slow acquisition of unfolded-state structure.},

When activated by an outside stimulus, they bind to a G protein inside the cell and accelerate exchange of a bound guanosine diphosphate (GDP) nucleotide for guanosine triphosphate, which initiates intercellular signaling. Dror et al. used atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations to show how GPCRs enhance GDP release. The G protein is dynamic and frequently adopts a conformation that exposes GDP even without the receptor bound. GPCR binding to this conformation favors an additional structural rearrangement that favors GDP release.

abstract = {Allosteric proteins bind an effector molecule at one site resulting in a functional change at a second site. We hypothesize that allosteric communication in proteins relies upon networks of quaternary (collective, rigid-body) and tertiary (residue-residue contact) motions. We argue that cyclic topology of these networks is necessary for allosteric communication. An automated algorithm identifies rigid bodies from the displacement between the inactive and the active structures and constructs "quaternary networks" from these rigid bodies and the substrate and effector ligands. We then integrate quaternary networks with a coarse-grained representation of contact rearrangements to form "global communication networks" (GCNs). The GCN reveals allosteric communication among all substrate and effector sites in 15 of 18 multidomain and multimeric proteins, while tertiary and quaternary networks exhibit such communication in only 4 and 3 of these proteins, respectively. Furthermore, in 7 of the 15 proteins connected by the GCN, 50% or more of the substrate-effector paths via the GCN are "interdependent" paths that do not exist via either the tertiary or the quaternary network. Substrate-effector "pathways" typically are not linear but rather consist of polycyclic networks of rigid bodies and clusters of rearranging residue contacts. These results argue for broad applicability of allosteric communication based on structural changes and demonstrate the utility of the GCN. Global communication networks may inform a variety of experiments on allosteric proteins as well as the design of allostery into non-allosteric proteins.},

abstract = {Recent evidence indicates that tyrosine phosphorylation may play important roles in retinal photoreceptor rod outer segments (ROS). We investigated the tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous proteins in isolated bovine ROS. Several proteins with apparent molecular masses of 31, 39, 60, 83, 90, 97, 120, 140, and 180 kDa were tyrosine-phosphorylated in ROS incubated with Mg(2+), ATP, and orthovanadate. Several tyrosine kinase inhibitors significantly inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins in ROS. The 39- and 60-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were identified as the alpha subunit of the G protein transducin (Talpha) and the tyrosine kinase Src, respectively. The presence of Src and tyrosine kinase activity in bovine ROS was confirmed by their cofractionation with rhodopsin and Talpha on continuous sucrose gradients. Several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, including Src, coimmunoprecipitated with Talpha. The association of Src with Talpha was detected in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation, but was enhanced with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of ROS. Moreover, tyrosine kinase activity also associated with Talpha was sevenfold higher under tyrosine-phosphorylating conditions. The recovery of transducin by hypotonic GTP extraction from tyrosine-phosphorylated ROS was significantly less than that from nonphosphorylated ROS. We localized the site on Talpha phosphorylated by Src to the amino-terminal half by limited tryptic digests, and further mapped it by ion trap mass spectrometry to Tyr(142) in the helical domain of Talpha. Talpha was also tyrosine-phosphorylated in vivo in rat retina, but this phosphorylation was not affected by light.},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of drug targets, largely owing to their druggability, diversity and physiological efficacy. Many drugs selectively target specific subtypes of GPCRs, but high specificity for individual GPCRs may not be desirable in complex multifactorial disease states in which multiple receptors may be involved. One approach is to target G protein subunits rather than the GPCRs directly. This approach has the potential to achieve broad efficacy by blocking pathways shared by multiple GPCRs. Additionally, because many GPCRs couple to multiple G protein signalling pathways, blocking specific G protein subunits can 'bias' GPCR signals by inhibiting only a subset of these signals. Molecules that target G protein $\alpha$ or $\beta$$\gamma$-subunits have been developed and show strong efficacy in multiple preclinical disease models and biased inhibition of G protein signalling. In this Review, we discuss the development and characterization of G protein $\alpha$ and $\beta$$\gamma$-subunit ligands and the preclinical evidence that this exciting new approach has potential for therapeutic efficacy in a number of indications, such as pain, thrombosis, asthma and heart failure.},

abstract = {The C5a chemoattractant factor receptor, when expressed in COS-7 cells, can stimulate phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C activity through the activation of the G16 isoform of the heterotrimeric G protein, but not through the G11 isoform. To identify the regions of the G alpha 16 subunit protein that are responsible for its activation by the C5a receptor, a series of chimeras between G alpha 16 and G alpha 11 were constructed and tested for their ability to be activated by the C5a receptor. Co-transfection experiments with chimeras in which the carboxyl-terminal regions of G alpha 11 were replaced with the corresponding regions of G alpha 16 demonstrated that changes in the carboxyl terminus, e.g., replacement of 134 amino acids, were not sufficient to confer receptor specificity. An additional segment encompassing residues 220-240 of G alpha 16 was required to confer C5a-induced activation. Testing of a reciprocal series of chimeras composed of G alpha 16 sequences at the amino terminus and G alpha 11 sequences at the carboxyl terminus revealed that certain sequences extending from the amino terminus to amino acid 209 of G alpha 16 were sufficient to endow the chimera with much of the specificity for C5a-induced activation. These results suggest that receptor specificity may involve specific conformations of the G protein stabilized by concerted interactions of multiple amino acid sequences distributed throughout the G alpha protein.},

abstract = {Accumulating evidence suggests that heterotrimeric G protein activation may not require G protein subunit dissociation. Results presented here provide evidence for a subunit dissociation-independent mechanism for G protein activation by a receptor-independent activator of G protein signaling, AGS8. AGS8 is a member of the AGS group III family of AGS proteins thought to activate G protein signaling primarily through interactions with Gbetagamma subunits. Results are presented demonstrating that AGS8 binds to the effector and alpha subunit binding "hot spot" on Gbetagamma yet does not interfere with Galpha subunit binding to Gbetagamma or phospholipase C beta2 activation. AGS8 stimulates activation of phospholipase C beta2 by heterotrimeric Galphabetagamma and forms a quaternary complex with Galpha(i1), Gbeta(1)gamma(2), and phospholipase C beta2. AGS8 rescued phospholipase C beta binding and regulation by an inactive beta subunit with a mutation in the hot spot (beta(1)(W99A)gamma(2)) that normally prevents binding and activation of phospholipase C beta2. This demonstrates that, in the presence of AGS8, the hot spot is not used for Gbetagamma interactions with phospholipase C beta2. Mutation of an alternate binding site for phospholipase C beta2 in the amino-terminal coiled-coil region of Gbetagamma prevented AGS8-dependent phospholipase C binding and activation. These data implicate a mechanism for AGS8, and potentially other Gbetagamma binding proteins, for directing Gbetagamma signaling through alternative effector activation sites on Gbetagamma in the absence of subunit dissociation.},

abstract = {We investigated the dissociation process of tri-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine from hen egg white lysozyme using parallel cascade selection molecular dynamics (PaCS-MD), which comprises cycles of multiple unbiased MD simulations using a selection of MD snapshots as the initial structures for the next cycle. Dissociation was significantly accelerated by PaCS-MD, in which the probability of rare event occurrence toward dissociation was enhanced by the selection and rerandomization of the initial velocities. Although this complex was stable during 1 $\mu$s of conventional MD, PaCS-MD easily induced dissociation within 100-101 ns. We found that velocity rerandomization enhances the dissociation of triNAG from the bound state, whereas diffusion plays a more important role in the unbound state. We calculated the dissociation free energy by analyzing all PaCS-MD trajectories using the Markov state model (MSM), compared the results to those obtained by combinations of PaCS-MD and umbrella sampling (US), steered MD (SMD) and US, and SMD and the Jarzynski equality, and experimentally determined binding free energy. PaCS-MD/MSM yielded results most comparable to the experimentally determined binding free energy, independent of simulation parameter variations, and also gave the lowest standard errors.},

abstract = {Recent methods for the analysis of molecular kinetics from massive molecular dynamics (MD) data rely on the solution of very large eigenvalue problems. Here we build upon recent results from the field of compressed sensing and develop the spectral oASIS method, a highly efficient approach to approximate the leading eigenvalues and eigenvectors of large generalized eigenvalue problems without ever having to evaluate the full matrices. The approach is demonstrated to reduce the dimensionality of the problem by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude, directly leading to corresponding savings in the computation and storage of the necessary matrices and a speedup of 2 to 4 orders of magnitude in solving the eigenvalue problem. We demonstrate the method on extensive data sets of protein conformational changes and protein-ligand binding using the variational approach to conformation dynamics (VAC) and time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA). Our approach can also be applied to kernel formulations of VAC, TICA, and extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD).},

abstract = {Brain capillaries play a critical role in sensing neural activity and translating it into dynamic changes in cerebral blood flow to serve the metabolic needs of the brain. The molecular cornerstone of this mechanism is the capillary endothelial cell inward rectifier K+(Kir2.1) channel, which is activated by neuronal activity-dependent increases in external K+concentration, producing a propagating hyperpolarizing electrical signal that dilates upstream arterioles. Here, we identify a key regulator of this process, demonstrating that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is an intrinsic modulator of capillary Kir2.1-mediated signaling. We further show that PIP2depletion through activation of Gqprotein-coupled receptors (GqPCRs) cripples capillary-to-arteriole signal transduction in vitro and in vivo, highlighting the potential regulatory linkage between GqPCR-dependent and electrical neurovascular-coupling mechanisms. These results collectively show that PIP2sets the gain of capillary-initiated electrical signaling by modulating Kir2.1 channels. Endothelial PIP2levels would therefore shape the extent of retrograde signaling and modulate cerebral blood flow.},

Chronic activation of the PLC$\epsilon$ isoform downstream of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) contributes to the development of cardiac hypertrophy. We have previously shown that PLC$\epsilon$-catalyzed hydrolysis of Golgi-associated phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) in cardiac myocytes depends on G protein $\beta$$\gamma$ subunits released upon stimulation with endothelin-1. PLC$\epsilon$ binds and is directly activated by Ras family small GTPases, but whether they directly interact with G$\beta$$\gamma$ has not been demonstrated. To identify PLC$\epsilon$ domains that interact with G$\beta$$\gamma$, here we designed various single substitutions and truncations of WT PLC$\epsilon$ and tested them for activation by G$\beta$$\gamma$ in transfected COS-7 cells. Deletion of only a single domain in PLC$\epsilon$ was not sufficient to completely block its activation by G$\beta$$\gamma$, but blocked activation by Ras. Simultaneous deletion of the C-terminal RA2 domain and the N-terminal CDC25 and cysteine-rich domains completely abrogated PLC$\epsilon$ activation by G$\beta$$\gamma$, but activation by the GTPase Rho was retained. In vitro reconstitution experiments further revealed that purified G$\beta$$\gamma$ directly interacts with a purified fragment of PLC$\epsilon$ (PLC$\epsilon$-PH-RA2) and increases PIP2 hydrolysis. Deletion of the RA2 domain decreased G$\beta$$\gamma$ binding and eliminated G$\beta$$\gamma$ stimulation of PIP2 hydrolysis. These results provide first evidence that G$\beta$$\gamma$ directly interacts with PLC$\epsilon$ and yield insights into the mechanism by which $\beta$$\gamma$ subunits activate PLC$\epsilon$.},

abstract = {Recent developments in specialized computer hardware have greatly accelerated atomic level Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. A single GPU-attached cluster is capable of producing microsecond-length trajectories in reasonable amounts of time. Multiple protein states and a large number of microstates associated with folding and with the function of the protein can be observed as conformations sampled in the trajectories. Clustering those conformations, however, is needed for identifying protein states, evaluating transition rates and understanding protein behavior. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven generative conformation clustering method based on the adversarial autoencoder (AAE) and provide the associated software implementation Cong. The method was tested using a 208 microseconds MD simulation of the fast-folding peptide Trp-Cage (20 residues) obtained from the D.E. Shaw Research Group. The proposed clustering algorithm identifies many of the salient features of the folding process by grouping a large number of conformations that share common features not easily identifiable in the trajectory.},

abstract = {Modulating protein activity with small-molecules binding to cryptic pockets offers great opportunities to overcome hurdles in drug design. Cryptic sites are atypical binding sites in proteins that are closed in the absence of a stabilizing ligand and are thus inherently difficult to identify. Many studies have proposed methods to predict cryptic sites. However, a general approach to prospectively sample open conformations of these sites and to identify cryptic pockets in an unbiased manner suitable for structure-based drug design remains elusive. Here, we describe an all-atom, explicit cosolvent, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations-based workflow to sample the open states of cryptic sites and identify opened pockets, in a manner that does not require a priori knowledge about these sites. Furthermore, the workflow relies on a target-independent parametrization that only distinguishes between binding pockets for peptides or small molecules. We validated our approach on a diverse test set of seven proteins with crystallographically determined cryptic sites. The known cryptic sites were found among the three highest-ranked predicted cryptic sites, and an open site conformation was sampled and selected for most of the systems. Crystallographic ligand poses were well reproduced by docking into these identified open conformations for five of the systems. When the fully open state could not be reproduced, we were still able to predict the location of the cryptic site, or identify other cryptic sites that could be retrospectively validated with knowledge of the protein target. These characteristics render our approach valuable for investigating novel protein targets without any prior information.},

Several human pathogens rely on an alternative flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase (FDTS), which differs from the human TSase both in structure and molecular mechanism. It has recently been shown that FDTS catalysis does not rely on an enzymatic nucleophile and that the proposed reaction intermediates are not covalently bound to the enzyme during catalysis, an important distinction from the human TSase. Here we report the chemical trapping, isolation, and identification of a derivative of such an intermediate in the FDTS-catalyzed reaction. The chemically modified reaction intermediate is consistent with currently proposed FDTS mechanisms that do not involve an enzymatic nucleophile, and it has never been observed during any other TSase reaction. These findings establish the timing of the methylene transfer during FDTS catalysis. The presented methodology provides an important experimental tool for further studies of FDTS, which may assist efforts directed toward the rational design of inhibitors as leads for future antibiotics.},

abstract = {Two regions on the alpha subunits of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins), the Switch II/$\alpha$2 helix (which changes conformation upon GDP-GTP exchange) and the $\alpha$3 helix, have been shown to contain the binding sites for their effector proteins. However, how the binding of G$\alpha$ subunits to their effector proteins is translated into the stimulation of effector activity is still poorly understood. Here, we took advantage of a reconstituted rhodopsin-coupled phototransduction system to address this question and identified a distinct surface and an essential residue on the alpha subunit of the G-protein transducin ($\alpha$T) that is necessary to fully activate its effector enzyme, the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE). We started with a chimeric G-protein alpha subunit ($\alpha$T*) comprising residues mainly from $\alpha$T and a short stretch of residues from the Gi1 alpha subunit ($\alpha$i1), which only weakly stimulates PDE activity. We then reinstated the $\alpha$T residues by systematically replacing the corresponding $\alpha$i1 residues within $\alpha$T* with the aim of fully restoring PDE stimulatory activity. These experiments revealed that the $\alpha$G/$\alpha$4 loop and a phenylalanine residue at position 283 are essential for conferring the $\alpha$T* subunit with full PDE stimulatory capability. We further demonstrated that this same region and amino acid within the alpha subunit of the Gs protein ($\alpha$s) are necessary for full adenylyl cyclase activation. These findings highlight the importance of the $\alpha$G/$\alpha$4 loop and an essential phenylalanine residue within this region on G$\alpha$ subunits $\alpha$T and $\alpha$s as being pivotal for their selective and optimal stimulation of effector activity.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, there has been a growing interest in investigating whether disordered proteins can be targeted for clinical purposes using small molecules (Metallo, 2010; Dunker and Uversky, 2010; Heller et al., 2015, 2017a; Michel and Cuchillo, 2012; Zhu et al., 2013; Ban et al., 2017; Csizmok et al., 2016 [1-8]). While small molecule binding to disordered proteins can be seen as unorthodox, examples of this phenomenon have been reported. In order to rationalize these observations, a variety of models are emerging, sometimes in apparent contradiction. Here, we offer a 'structural ensemble modulation' view as an attempt to clarify the language, organize concepts, and facilitate the comparison of different studies. In doing so, we hope to promote and accelerate the understanding of the general principles underlying this phenomenon towards the development of novel therapeutic compounds targeting disordered proteins, which are prevalent in a wide range of human diseases (Metallo, 2010; Dunker and Uversky, 2010; Heller et al., 2015, 2017a; Michel and Cuchillo, 2012; Zhu et al., 2013; Ban et al., 2017; Csizmok et al., 2016 [1-8]).},

abstract = {ConspectusThis Account highlights recent advances and discusses major challenges in investigations of cryptic (hidden) binding sites by molecular simulations. Cryptic binding sites are not visible in protein targets crystallized without a ligand and only become visible crystallographically upon binding events. These sites have been shown to be druggable and might provide a rare opportunity to target difficult proteins. However, due to their hidden nature, they are difficult to find through experimental screening. Computational methods based on atomistic molecular simulations remain one of the best approaches to identify and characterize cryptic binding sites. However, not all methods are equally efficient. Some are more apt at quickly probing protein dynamics but do not provide thermodynamic or druggability information, while others that are able to provide such data are demanding in terms of time and resources. Here, we review the recent contributions of mixed-solvent simulations, metadynamics, Markov state models, and other enhanced sampling methods to the field of cryptic site identification and characterization. We discuss how these methods were able to provide precious information on the nature of the site opening mechanisms, to predict previously unknown sites which were used to design new ligands, and to compute the free energy landscapes and kinetics associated with the opening of the sites and the binding of the ligands. We highlight the potential and the importance of such predictions in drug discovery, especially for difficult ({\textquotedblleft}undruggable{\textquotedblright}) targets. We also discuss the major challenges in the field and their possible solutions.},

abstract = {Allostery describes altered protein function at one site due to a perturbation at another site. One mechanism of allostery involves correlated motions, which can occur even in the absence of substantial conformational change. We present a novel method, "MutInf", to identify statistically significant correlated motions from equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach analyzes both backbone and sidechain motions using internal coordinates to account for the gear-like twists that can take place even in the absence of the large conformational changes typical of traditional allosteric proteins. We quantify correlated motions using a mutual information metric, which we extend to incorporate data from multiple short simulations and to filter out correlations that are not statistically significant. Applying our approach to uncover mechanisms of cooperative small molecule binding in human interleukin-2, we identify clusters of correlated residues from 50 ns of molecular dynamics simulations. Interestingly, two of the clusters with the strongest correlations highlight known cooperative small-molecule binding sites and show substantial correlations between these sites. These cooperative binding sites on interleukin-2 are correlated not only through the hydrophobic core of the protein but also through a dynamic polar network of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. Since this approach identifies correlated conformations in an unbiased, statistically robust manner, it should be a useful tool for finding novel or "orphan" allosteric sites in proteins of biological and therapeutic importance.},

abstract = {Iron is essential for pathogen survival, virulence, and colonization. Feo is suggested to function as the ferrous iron (Fe(2+)) transporter. The enterobacterial Feo system is composed of 3 proteins: FeoB is the indispensable component and is a large membrane protein likely to function as a permease; FeoA is a small Src homology 3 (SH3) domain protein that interacts with FeoB; FeoC is a winged-helix protein containing 4 conserved Cys residues in a sequence suitable for harboring a putative iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster. The presence of an iron-sulfur cluster on FeoC has never been shown experimentally. We report that under anaerobic conditions, the recombinant Klebsiella pneumoniae FeoC (KpFeoC) exhibited hyperfine-shifted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and a UV-visible (UV-Vis) absorbance spectrum characteristic of a paramagnetic center. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) results were consistent only with the [4Fe-4S] clusters. Substituting the cysteinyl sulfur with oxygen resulted in significantly reduced cluster stability, establishing the roles of these cysteines as the ligands for the Fe-S cluster. When exposed to oxygen, the [4Fe-4S] cluster degraded to [3Fe-4S] and eventually disappeared. We propose that KpFeoC may regulate the function of the Feo transporter through the oxygen- or iron-sensitive coordination of the Fe-S cluster.},

abstract = {The interaction between a ligand and a protein involves a multitude of conformational states. To achieve a particular deeply bound pose, the ligand must search across a rough free-energy landscape with many metastable minima. Creating maps of the ligand binding landscape is a great challenge, as binding and release events typically occur on timescales that are beyond the reach of molecular simulation. The WExplore enhanced sampling method is well suited to build these maps because it is designed to broadly explore free-energy landscapes and is capable of simulating ligand release pathways that occur on timescales as long as minutes. WExplore also uses only unbiased trajectory segments, allowing for the construction of Markov state models (MSMs) and conformation space networks that combine the results of multiple simulations. Here, we use WExplore to study two bromodomain-inhibitor systems using multiple docked starting poses (Brd4-MS436 and Baz2B-ICR7) and synthesize our results using a series of MSMs using time-lagged independent component analysis. Ranking the starting poses by exit rate agrees with the crystal structure pose in both cases. We also predict the most stable pose using the equilibrium populations from the MSM but find that the prediction is not robust as a function of MSM parameters. The simulated trajectories are synthesized into network models that visualize the entire binding landscape for each system, and we examine transition paths between deeply bound stable states. We find that, on average, transitions between deeply bound states convert through the unbound state 81% of the time, implying a trial-and-error approach to ligand binding. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this result for both kinetics-based drug discovery and virtual screening pipelines that incorporate molecular dynamics.},

abstract = {Lipidated small GTPases and their regulators need to bind to membranes to propagate actions in the cell, but an integrated understanding of how the lipid bilayer exerts its effect has remained elusive. Here we focused on ADP ribosylation factor (Arf) GTPases, which orchestrate a variety of regulatory functions in lipid and membrane trafficking, and their activation by the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Brag2, which controls integrin endocytosis and cell adhesion and is impaired in cancer and developmental diseases. Biochemical and structural data are available that showed the exceptional efficiency of Arf activation by Brag2 on membranes. We determined the high-resolution crystal structure of unbound Brag2 containing the GEF (Sec7) and membrane-binding (pleckstrin homology) domains, revealing that it has a constitutively active conformation. We used this structure to analyze the interaction of uncomplexed Brag2 and of the myristoylated Arf1/Brag2 complex with a phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) -containing lipid bilayer, using coarse-grained molecular dynamics. These simulations revealed that the system forms a close-packed, oriented interaction with the membrane, in which multiple PIP2 lipids bind the canonical lipid-binding site and unique peripheral sites of the PH domain, the Arf GTPase and, unexpectedly, the Sec7 domain. We cross-validated these predictions by reconstituting the binding and kinetics of Arf and Brag2 in artificial membranes. Our coarse-grained structural model thus suggests that the high efficiency of Brag2 requires interaction with multiple lipids and a well-defined orientation on the membrane, resulting in a local PIP2 enrichment, which has the potential to signal toward the Arf pathway.},

In this formulation the MD cell shape and size can change according to dynamical equations given by this Lagrangian. This new MD technique is well suited to the study of structural transformations in solids under external stress and at finite temperature. As an example of the use of this technique we show how a single crystal of Ni behaves under uniform uniaxial compressive and tensile loads. This work confirms some of the results of static (i.e., zero temperature) calculations reported in the literature. We also show that some results regarding the stress-strain relation obtained by static calculations are invalid at finite temperature. We find that, under compressive loading, our model of Ni shows a bifurcation in its stress-strain relation; this bifurcation provides a link in configuration space between cubic and hexagonal close packing. It is suggested that such a transformation could perhaps be observed experimentally under extreme conditions of shock.},

abstract = {Ras superfamily GTP-binding proteins regulate important signaling events in the cell. Ras, which often serves as a prototype, efficiently hydrolyzes GTP in conjunction with its regulator GAP. A conserved glutamine plays a vital role in GTP hydrolysis in most GTP-binding proteins. Mutating this glutamine in Ras has oncogenic effects, since it disrupts GTP hydrolysis. The analysis presented here is of GTP-binding proteins that are a paradox to oncogenic Ras, since they have the catalytic glutamine (Glncat) substituted by a hydrophobic amino acid, yet can hydrolyze GTP efficiently. We term these proteins HAS-GTPases. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of HAS-GTPases reveals prominent presence of insertions around the GTP-binding pocket. Homology modeling studies suggest an interesting means to achieve catalysis despite the drastic hydrophobic substitution replacing the key Glncat of Ras-like GTPases. The substituted hydrophobic residue adopts a "retracted conformation," where it is positioned away from the GTP, as its role in catalysis would be unproductive. This conformation is further stabilized by interactions with hydrophobic residues in its vicinity. These interacting residues are strongly conserved and hydrophobic in all HAS-GTPases, and correspond to residues Asp92 and Tyr96 of Ras. An experimental support for the "retracted conformation" of Switch II arises from the crystal structures of Ylqf and hGBP1. This conformation allows us to hypothesize that, unlike in classical GTPases, catalytic residues could be supplied by regions other than the Switch II (i.e., either the insertions or a neighboring domain).},

abstract = {Despite the discovery of heterotrimeric $\alpha$$\beta$$\gamma$ G proteins ∼25 years ago, their selective perturbation by cell-permeable inhibitors remains a fundamental challenge. Here we report that the plant-derived depsipeptide FR900359 (FR) is ideally suited to this task. Using a multifaceted approach we systematically characterize FR as a selective inhibitor of Gq/11/14 over all other mammalian G$\alpha$ isoforms and elaborate its molecular mechanism of action. We also use FR to investigate whether inhibition of Gq proteins is an effective post-receptor strategy to target oncogenic signalling, using melanoma as a model system. FR suppresses many of the hallmark features that are central to the malignancy of melanoma cells, thereby providing new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Just as pertussis toxin is used extensively to probe and inhibit the signalling of Gi/o proteins, we anticipate that FR will at least be its equivalent for investigating the biological relevance of Gq.},

abstract = {Allostery describes altered protein function at one site due to a perturbation at another site. One mechanism of allostery involves correlated motions, which can occur even in the absence of substantial conformational change. We present a novel method, "MutInf", to identify statistically significant correlated motions from equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach analyzes both backbone and sidechain motions using internal coordinates to account for the gear-like twists that can take place even in the absence of the large conformational changes typical of traditional allosteric proteins. We quantify correlated motions using a mutual information metric, which we extend to incorporate data from multiple short simulations and to filter out correlations that are not statistically significant. Applying our approach to uncover mechanisms of cooperative small molecule binding in human interleukin-2, we identify clusters of correlated residues from 50 ns of molecular dynamics simulations. Interestingly, two of the clusters with the strongest correlations highlight known cooperative small-molecule binding sites and show substantial correlations between these sites. These cooperative binding sites on interleukin-2 are correlated not only through the hydrophobic core of the protein but also through a dynamic polar network of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. Since this approach identifies correlated conformations in an unbiased, statistically robust manner, it should be a useful tool for finding novel or "orphan" allosteric sites in proteins of biological and therapeutic importance.},

abstract = {Suramin acts as a G protein inhibitor because it inhibits the rate-limiting step in activation of the Galpha subunit, i.e., the exchange of GDP for GTP. Here, we have searched for analogues that are selective for Gsalpha. Two compounds have been identified: NF449 (4,4',4",4'"-[carbonyl-bis[imino-5,1,3-benzenetriyl bis-(carbonylimino)]]tetrakis-(benzene-1,3-disulfonate) and NF503 (4, 4'-[carbonylbis[imino-3,1-phenylene-(2, 5-benzimidazolylene)carbonylimino]]bis-benzenesulfonate). These compounds (i) suppress the association rate of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate ([35S]GTP[gammaS]) binding to Gsalpha-s but not to Gialpha-1, (ii) inhibit stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity in S49 cyc- membranes (deficient in endogenous Gsalpha) by exogenously added Gsalpha-s, and (iii) block the coupling of beta-adrenergic receptors to Gs with half-maximum effects in the low micromolar range. In contrast to suramin, which is not selective, NF503 and NF449 disrupt the interaction of the A1-adenosine receptor with its cognate G proteins (Gi/Go) at concentrations that are >30-fold higher than those required for uncoupling of beta-adrenergic receptor/Gs tandems; similarly, the angiotensin II type-1 receptor (a prototypical Gq-coupled receptor) is barely affected by the compounds. Thus, NF503 and NF449 fulfill essential criteria for Gsalpha-selective antagonists. The observations demonstrate the feasibility of subtype-selective G protein inhibition.},

Recently, this obligatory paradigm has been challenged. A growing body of evidence indicates that 7-TM receptors can also transmit extracellular signals through mechanisms that function independently of G-protein coupling. This review discusses pathways and protein interactions for 7-TM receptors signaling "at zero G" in Dictyostelium and mammalian cells.},

abstract = {The crystal structures of opsin in the ligand-free and the G-protein-interacting states showed two inter-helical openings between transmembrane (TM) helices TM1 and TM7 and between TM5 and TM6 near the extracellular side that were thought to serve as the retinal uptake and release gates. However, it is unclear which opening is for 11-cis-retinal uptake or all-trans-retinal release although speculations have been proposed based on the structural features of opsin and retinal. In this work, we simulated the exit process of all-trans-retinal from the ligand-free opsin structure by the classical molecular dynamics (MD) and random acceleration molecular dynamics (RAMD). In the 64 ns classical MD simulation, retinal remained in the receptor but moved significantly toward the TM5-TM6 opening and almost inserted into the opening after 50 ns. Complete exit was observed in 114 out of 160 RAMD trajectories with the TM5-TM6 opening being the predominant egress gate while egress from the TM1-TM7 opening was observed in only a few trajectories when relatively large acceleration was applied and large structural alteration of the protein resulted. These results suggest that photolyzed all-trans-retinal is likely released through the TM5-TM6 opening. Based on the unidirectional mechanism of retinal exchange suggested by experiment, we speculate that the TM1-TM7 opening serves as the 11-cis-retinal uptake gate. The spatial occupancy maps of retinal computed from the 160 RAMD trajectories further indicated that retinal experienced significant interactions with the receptor during the exit process. The implications of these findings for disease mechanisms of rhodopsin mutants are discussed.},

Understanding the conformational changes and timelines that govern these changes can lead to new insights into the processes of ligand binding and associated G protein activation. Experimental systems may involve the use of, or otherwise stabilize, non-native environments. This can complicate our understanding of structural and dynamic features of processes such as the ionic lock, tryptophan toggle, and G protein flexibility. While elements in the receptor's transmembrane helices and the C-terminal $\alpha$5 helix of G$\alpha$ undergo well-defined structural changes, regions subject to conformational flexibility may be important in fine-tuning the interactions between activated receptors and G proteins. The pairing of computational and experimental approaches will continue to provide powerful tools to probe the conformation and dynamics of receptor-mediated G protein activation.},

abstract = {<p>Obstructive lung diseases are common causes of disability and death worldwide. A hallmark feature is aberrant activation of G<sub>q</sub> protein{\textendash}dependent signaling cascades. Currently, drugs targeting single G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide{\textendash}binding protein){\textendash}coupled receptors (GPCRs) are used to reduce airway tone. However, therapeutic efficacy is often limited, because various GPCRs contribute to bronchoconstriction, and chronic exposure to receptor-activating medications results in desensitization. We therefore hypothesized that pharmacological G<sub>q</sub> inhibition could serve as a central mechanism to achieve efficient therapeutic bronchorelaxation. We found that the compound FR900359 (FR), a membrane-permeable inhibitor of G<sub>q</sub>, was effective in silencing G<sub>q</sub> signaling in murine and human airway smooth muscle cells. Moreover, FR both prevented bronchoconstrictor responses and triggered sustained airway relaxation in mouse, pig, and human airway tissue ex vivo. Inhalation of FR in healthy wild-type mice resulted in high local concentrations of the compound in the lungs and prevented airway constriction without acute effects on blood pressure and heart rate. FR administration also protected against airway hyperreactivity in murine models of allergen sensitization using ovalbumin and house dust mite as allergens. Our findings establish FR as a selective G<sub>q</sub> inhibitor when applied locally to the airways of mice in vivo and suggest that pharmacological blockade of G<sub>q</sub> proteins may be a useful therapeutic strategy to achieve bronchorelaxation in asthmatic lung disease.</p>},

However, understanding the nature of the information transmitted and the architectures optimizing such transmission remains a challenge. Here we show, using an in~silico evolution scheme and theoretical arguments, that architectures optimized to be cooperative, which efficiently propagate energy, qualitatively differ from previously investigated materials optimized to propagate strain. Although we observe a large diversity of functioning cooperative architectures (including shear, hinge, and twist designs), they all obey the same principle of displaying a mechanism, i.e., an extended soft mode. We show that its optimal frequency decreases with the spatial extension~L of the system as L-d/2, where d is the spatial dimension. For these optimal designs, cooperativity decays logarithmically with L for d~= 2 and does not decay for d~= 3. Overall, our approach leads to a natural explanation for several observations in allosteric proteins and indicates an experimental path to test if allosteric proteins lie close to optimality.},

We recently demonstrated that Src kinase features an allosteric network that couples substrate-binding sites. However, the extent of conformational and dynamic changes that are propagated throughout the kinase domain remains poorly understood. Here, we monitor by NMR the effect of conformationally selective inhibitors on kinase backbone dynamics. We find that inhibitor binding and activation loop autophosphorylation induces dynamic changes across the entire kinase. We identify a highly conserved amino acid, Gly449, that is necessary for Src activation. Finally, we show for the first time how the SH3-SH2 domains perturb the dynamics of the kinase domain in the context of the full length protein. We provide experimental support for long-range communication in Src kinase that leads to the relative stabilization of active or inactive conformations and modulation of substrate affinity.},

These responses can be highly dynamic, but how the information is encoded in these dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the dynamic encoding of information in the ATP-induced calcium responses of fibroblast cells, using a vectorial, or multi-time-point, measure from information theory. We find that the amount of extracted information depends on physiological constraints such as the sampling rate and memory capacity of the downstream network, and it is affected differentially by intrinsic versus extrinsic noise. By comparing to a minimal physical model, we find, surprisingly, that the information is often insensitive to the detailed structure of the underlying dynamics, and instead the decoding mechanism acts as a simple low-pass filter. These results demonstrate the mechanisms and limitations of dynamic information storage in cells.},

abstract = {<p>A large number of complex systems find a natural abstraction in the form of weighted networks whose nodes represent the elements of the system and the weighted edges identify the presence of an interaction and its relative strength. In recent years, the study of an increasing number of large-scale networks has highlighted the statistical heterogeneity of their interaction pattern, with degree and weight distributions that vary over many orders of magnitude. These features, along with the large number of elements and links, make the extraction of the truly relevant connections forming the network9s backbone a very challenging problem. More specifically, coarse-graining approaches and filtering techniques come into conflict with the multiscale nature of large-scale systems. Here, we define a filtering method that offers a practical procedure to extract the relevant connection backbone in complex multiscale networks, preserving the edges that represent statistically significant deviations with respect to a null model for the local assignment of weights to edges. An important aspect of the method is that it does not belittle small-scale interactions and operates at all scales defined by the weight distribution. We apply our method to real-world network instances and compare the obtained results with alternative backbone extraction techniques.</p>},

abstract = {Since the discovery of spin glasses in dilute magnetic systems, their study has been largely focused on understanding randomness and defects as the driving mechanism. The same paradigm has also been applied to explain glassy states found in dense frustrated systems. Recently, however, it has been theoretically suggested that different mechanisms, such as quantum fluctuations and topological features, may induce glassy states in defect-free spin systems, far from the conventional dilute limit. Here we report experimental evidence for existence of a glassy state, which we call a spin jam, in the vicinity of the clean limit of a frustrated magnet, which is insensitive to a low concentration of defects. We have studied the effect of impurities on SrCr9pGa12-9pO19 [SCGO(p)], a highly frustrated magnet, in which the magnetic Cr(3+) (s = 3/2) ions form a quasi-2D triangular system of bipyramids. Our experimental data show that as the nonmagnetic Ga(3+) impurity concentration is changed, there are two distinct phases of glassiness: an exotic glassy state, which we call a spin jam, for the high magnetic concentration region (p > 0.8) and a cluster spin glass for lower magnetic concentration (p < 0.8). This observation indicates that a spin jam is a unique vantage point from which the class of glassy states of dense frustrated magnets can be understood.},

Despite the growing number of online servers and databases devoted to prediction/classification of allosteric sites and their characteristics, there is a lack of resources for an efficient and quick estimation of the causality and energetics of allosteric communication.

Results:The AlloSigMA server implements a unique approach on the basis of the recently introduced structure-based statistical mechanical models of allosteric signaling. It provides an interactive framework for estimating the allosteric free energy as a result of the ligand(s) binding, mutation(s) and their combinations. Latent regulatory exosites and allosteric effect of mutations can be detected and explored, facilitating the research efforts in protein engineering and allosteric drug design.

abstract = {Markov State Model (MSM) has become a popular approach to study the conformational dynamics of complex biological systems in recent years. Built upon a large number of short molecular dynamics simulation trajectories, MSM is able to predict the long time scale dynamics of complex systems. However, to achieve Markovianity, an MSM often contains hundreds or thousands of states (microstates), hindering human interpretation of the underlying system mechanism. One way to reduce the number of states is to lump kinetically similar states together and thus coarse-grain the microstates into macrostates. In this work, we introduce a probabilistic lumping algorithm, the Gibbs lumping algorithm, to assign a probability to any given kinetic lumping using the Bayesian inference.

abstract = {We propose a thermodynamic interpretation of transfer entropy near equilibrium, using a specialised Boltzmann{\textquoteright}s principle. The approach relates conditional probabilities to the probabilities of the corresponding state transitions. This in turn characterises transfer entropy as a difference of two entropy rates: the rate for a resultant transition and another rate for a possibly irreversible transition within the system affected by an additional source. We then show that this difference, the local transfer entropy, is proportional to the external entropy production, possibly due to irreversibility. Near equilibrium, transfer entropy is also interpreted as the difference in equilibrium stabilities with respect to two scenarios: a default case and the case with an additional source. Finally, we demonstrated that such a thermodynamic treatment is not applicable to information flow, a measure of causal effect.},

abstract = {Signal transduction networks allow eukaryotic cells to make decisions based on information about intracellular state and the environment. Biochemical noise significantly diminishes the fidelity of signaling: networks examined to date seem to transmit less than 1 bit of information. It is unclear how networks that control critical cell-fate decisions (e.g., cell division and apoptosis) can function with such low levels of information transfer. Here, we use theory, experiments, and numerical analysis to demonstrate an inherent trade-off between the information transferred in individual cells and the information available to control population-level responses. Noise in receptor-mediated apoptosis reduces information transfer to approximately 1 bit at the single-cell level but allows 3-4 bits of information to be transmitted at the population level. For processes such as eukaryotic chemotaxis, in which single cells are the functional unit, we find high levels of information transmission at a single-cell level. Thus, low levels of information transfer are unlikely to represent a physical limit. Instead, we propose that signaling networks exploit noise at the single-cell level to increase population-level information transfer, allowing extracellular ligands, whose levels are also subject to noise, to incrementally regulate phenotypic changes. This is particularly critical for discrete changes in fate (e.g., life vs. death) for which the key variable is the fraction of cells engaged. Our findings provide a framework for rationalizing the high levels of noise in metazoan signaling networks and have implications for the development of drugs that target these networks in the treatment of cancer and other diseases.},

abstract = {The understanding of protein-ligand binding is of critical importance for biomedical research, yet the process itself has been very difficult to study because of its intrinsically dynamic character. Here, we have been able to quantitatively reconstruct the complete binding process of the enzyme-inhibitor complex trypsin-benzamidine by performing 495 molecular dynamics simulations of free ligand binding of 100~ns each, 187 of which produced binding events with an rmsd less than 2~{\AA} compared to the crystal structure. The binding paths obtained are able to capture the kinetic pathway of the inhibitor diffusing from solvent (S0) to the bound (S4) state passing through two metastable intermediate states S2 and S3. Rather than directly entering the binding pocket the inhibitor appears to roll on the surface of the protein in its transition between S3 and the final binding pocket, whereas the transition between S2 and the bound pose requires rediffusion to S3. An estimation of the standard free energy of binding gives $\Delta$G{\textdegree}~=~-5.2~{\textpm}~0.4~kcal/mol (cf. the experimental value -6.2~kcal/mol), and a two-states kinetic model k(on)~=~(1.5~{\textpm}~0.2)~{\texttimes}~10(8)~M(-1)~s(-1) and k(off)~=~(9.5~{\textpm}~3.3)~{\texttimes}~10(4)~s(-1) for unbound to bound transitions. The ability to reconstruct by simple diffusion the binding pathway of an enzyme-inhibitor binding process demonstrates the predictive power of unconventional high-throughput molecular simulations. Moreover, the methodology is directly applicable to other molecular systems and thus of general interest in biomedical and pharmaceutical research.},

Exchange-time distributions are shown to be particularly sensitive to the model parameters and dimensions, and exhibit more structured and richer behavior than persistence-time distributions. Mean exchange times are shown to be Arrhenius, regardless of models and spatial dimensions. Specifically, tx approximately c-2, with c being the excitation concentration. Different dynamical exchange processes are identified and characterized from the underlying trajectories. We discuss experimental possibilities to test some of our theoretical findings.},

abstract = {The Galpha subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (Galphabetagamma) mediate signal transduction via activation by receptors and subsequent interaction with downstream effectors. Crystal structures indicate that conformational changes in "switch" sequences of Galpha, controlled by the identity of the bound nucleotide (GDP and GTP), modulate binding affinities to the Gbetagamma subunits, receptor, and effector proteins. To investigate the solution structure and dynamics of Galphai1 through the G protein cycle, nitroxide side chains (R1) were introduced at sites in switch II and at a site in helix alpha4, a putative effector binding region. In the inactive Galphai1(GDP) state, the EPR spectra are compatible with conformational polymorphism in switch II. Upon complex formation with Gbetagamma, motions of R1 are highly constrained, reflecting direct contact interactions at the Galphai1-Gbeta interface; remarkably, the presence of R1 at the sites investigated does not substantially affect the binding affinity. Complex formation between the heterotrimer and activated rhodopsin leads to a dramatic change in R1 motion at residue 217 in the receptor-binding alpha2/beta4 loop and smaller allosteric changes at the Galphai1-Gbetagamma interface distant from the receptor binding surface. Upon addition of GTPgammaS, the activated Galphai1(GTP) subunit dissociates from the complex, and switch II is transformed to a unique conformation similar to that in crystal structures but with a flexible backbone. A previously unreported activation-dependent change in alpha4, distant from the interaction surface, supports a role for this helix in effector binding.},

They also constitute an excellent model system for the difficult problem of understanding how allosteric mutations can augment catalytic activity of already-competent enzymes. Multiple allosteric mutations have been identified that alter catalytic activity or drug-resistance spectrum in class A beta lactamases, but predicting these in advance continues to be challenging. Here, we review computational techniques based on structure and/or molecular simulation to predict such mutations. Structure-based techniques have been particularly helpful in developing graph algorithms for analyzing critical residues in beta-lactamase function, while classical molecular simulation has recently shown the ability to prospectively predict allosteric mutations increasing beta-lactamase activity and drug resistance. These will ultimately achieve the greatest power when combined with simulation methods that model reactive chemistry to calculate activation free energies directly.},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are responsible for the majority of cellular responses to hormones and neurotransmitters as well as the senses of sight, olfaction and taste. The paradigm of GPCR signalling is the activation of a heterotrimeric GTP binding protein (G protein) by an agonist-occupied receptor. The $\beta$(2) adrenergic receptor ($\beta$(2)AR) activation of Gs, the stimulatory G protein for adenylyl cyclase, has long been a model system for GPCR signalling. Here we present the crystal structure of the active state ternary complex composed of agonist-occupied monomeric $\beta$(2)AR and nucleotide-free Gs heterotrimer. The principal interactions between the $\beta$(2)AR and Gs involve the amino- and carboxy-terminal $\alpha$-helices of Gs, with conformational changes propagating to the nucleotide-binding pocket. The largest conformational changes in the $\beta$(2)AR include a 14 {\AA} outward movement at the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment 6 (TM6) and an $\alpha$-helical extension of the cytoplasmic end of TM5. The most surprising observation is a major displacement of the $\alpha$-helical domain of G$\alpha$s relative to the Ras-like GTPase domain. This crystal structure represents the first high-resolution view of transmembrane signalling by a GPCR.},

abstract = {Inhibition of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is emerging as a promising therapeutic strategy despite the difficulty in targeting such interfaces with drug-like small molecules. PPIs generally feature large and flat binding surfaces as compared to typical drug targets. These features pose a challenge for structural characterization of the surface using geometry-based pocket-detection methods. An attractive mapping strategy--that builds on the principles of fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD)--is to detect the fragment-centric modularity at the protein surface and then characterize the large PPI interface as a set of localized, fragment-targetable interaction regions. Here, we introduce AlphaSpace, a computational analysis tool designed for fragment-centric topographical mapping (FCTM) of PPI interfaces. Our approach uses the alpha sphere construct, a geometric feature of a protein's Voronoi diagram, to map out concave interaction space at the protein surface. We introduce two new features--alpha-atom and alpha-space--and the concept of the alpha-atom/alpha-space pair to rank pockets for fragment-targetability and to facilitate the evaluation of pocket/fragment complementarity. The resulting high-resolution interfacial map of targetable pocket space can be used to guide the rational design and optimization of small molecule or biomimetic PPI inhibitors.},

abstract = {We propose a simple method to extract the community structure of large networks. Our method is a heuristic method that is based on modularity optimization. It is shown to outperform all other known community detection method in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2.6 million customers and by analyzing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad-hoc modular networks. .

abstract = {Allosteric drug development holds promise for delivering medicines that are more selective and less toxic than those that target orthosteric sites. To date, the discovery of allosteric binding sites and lead compounds has been mostly serendipitous, achieved through high-throughput screening. Over the past decade, structural data has become more readily available for larger protein systems and more membrane protein classes (e.g., GPCRs and ion channels), which are common allosteric drug targets. In parallel, improved simulation methods now provide better atomistic understanding of the protein dynamics and cooperative motions that are critical to allosteric mechanisms. As a result of these advances, the field of predictive allosteric drug development is now on the cusp of a new era of rational structure-based computational methods. Here, we review algorithms that predict allosteric sites based on sequence data and molecular dynamics simulations, describe tools that assess the druggability of these pockets, and discuss how Markov state models and topology analyses provide insight into the relationship between protein dynamics and allosteric drug binding. In each section, we first provide an overview of the various method classes before describing relevant algorithms and software packages.},

abstract = {Enzyme engineering has been facilitated by recombination of close homologues, followed by functional screening. In one such effort, chimeras of two class-A $\beta$-lactamases - TEM-1 and PSE-4 - were created according to structure-guided protein recombination and selected for their capacity to promote bacterial proliferation in the presence of ampicillin (Voigt et al., Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002 9:553). To provide a more detailed assessment of the effects of protein recombination on the structure and function of the resulting chimeric enzymes, we characterized a series of functional TEM-1/PSE-4 chimeras possessing between 17 and 92 substitutions relative to TEM-1 $\beta$-lactamase. Circular dichroism and thermal scanning fluorimetry revealed that the chimeras were generally well folded. Despite harbouring important sequence variation relative to either of the two 'parental' $\beta$-lactamases, the chimeric $\beta$-lactamases displayed substrate recognition spectra and reactivity similar to their most closely-related parent. To gain further insight into the changes induced by chimerization, the chimera with 17 substitutions was investigated by NMR spin relaxation. While high order was conserved on the ps-ns timescale, a hallmark of class A $\beta$-lactamases, evidence of additional slow motions on the {\textmu}s-ms timescale was extracted from model-free calculations. This is consistent with the greater number of resonances that could not be assigned in this chimera relative to the parental $\beta$-lactamases, and is consistent with this well-folded and functional chimeric $\beta$-lactamase displaying increased slow time-scale motions.},

abstract = {Understanding the conformational changes associated with the binding of small ligands to their biological targets is a fascinating and meaningful question in chemistry, biology and drug discovery. One of the most studied and important is the so-called "DFG-flip" of tyrosine kinases. The conserved three amino-acid DFG motif undergoes an "in to out" movement resulting in a particular inactive conformation to which "type II" kinase inhibitors, such as the anti-cancer drug Imatinib, bind. Despite many studies, the details of this prototypical conformational change are still debated. Here we combine various NMR experiments and surface plasmon resonance with enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations to shed light into the conformational dynamics associated with the binding of Imatinib to the proto-oncogene c-Src. We find that both conformational selection and induced fit play a role in the binding mechanism, reconciling opposing views held in the literature. Moreover, an external binding pose and local unfolding (cracking) of the aG helix are observed. },

Among these are changes in protein conformational entropy, which cannot yet be reliably computed from molecular structures. We have recently used changes in conformational dynamics as a proxy for changes in conformational entropy of calmodulin upon association with domains from regulated proteins. The apparent change in conformational entropy was linearly related to the overall binding entropy. This view warrants a more quantitative foundation. Here we calibrate an 'entropy meter' using an experimental dynamical proxy based on NMR relaxation and show that changes in the conformational entropy of calmodulin are a significant component of the energetics of binding. Furthermore, the distribution of motion at the interface between the target domain and calmodulin is surprisingly noncomplementary. These observations promote modification of our understanding of the energetics of protein-ligand interactions.},

abstract = {The discovery of drug-like molecules that bind pockets in proteins that are not present in crystallographic structures yet exert allosteric control over activity has generated great interest in designing pharmaceuticals that exploit allosteric effects. However, there have only been a small number of successes, so the therapeutic potential of these pockets--called hidden allosteric sites--remains unclear. One challenge for assessing their utility is that rational drug design approaches require foreknowledge of the target site, but most hidden allosteric sites are only discovered when a small molecule is found to stabilize them. We present a means of decoupling the identification of hidden allosteric sites from the discovery of drugs that bind them by drawing on new developments in Markov state modeling that provide unprecedented access to microsecond- to millisecond-timescale fluctuations of a protein's structure. Visualizing these fluctuations allows us to identify potential hidden allosteric sites, which we then test via thiol labeling experiments. Application of these methods reveals multiple hidden allosteric sites in an important antibiotic target--TEM-1 $\beta$-lactamase. This result supports the hypothesis that there are many as yet undiscovered hidden allosteric sites and suggests our methodology can identify such sites, providing a starting point for future drug design efforts. More generally, our results demonstrate the power of using Markov state models to guide experiments.},

They couple to GPCRs and recapitulate the increase in agonist affinity observed upon coupling of a native heterotrimeric G protein. Given the small size and stability of mini-G proteins, and their ease of expression and purification, they are ideal for biophysical studies of GPCRs in their fully active state. The first mini-G protein developed was mini-Gs. Here we extend the family of mini-G proteins to include mini-Golf, mini-Gi1, mini-Go1 and the chimeras mini-Gs/q and mini-Gs/i. The mini-G proteins were shown to couple to relevant GPCRs and to form stable complexes with purified receptors that could be purified by size exclusion chromatography. Agonist-bound GPCRs coupled to a mini-G protein showed higher thermal stability compared to the agonist-bound receptor alone. Fusion of GFP at the N-terminus of mini-G proteins allowed receptor coupling to be monitored by fluorescence-detection size exclusion chromatography (FSEC) and, in a separate assay, the affinity of mini-G protein binding to detergent-solubilised receptors was determined. This work provides the foundation for the development of any mini-G protein and, ultimately, for the structure determination of GPCRs in a fully active state.},

abstract = {A quantitative characterization of the binding properties of drug fragments to a target protein is an important component of a fragment-based drug discovery program. Fragments typically have a weak binding affinity, however, making it challenging to experimentally characterize key binding properties, including binding sites, poses, and affinities. Direct simulation of the binding equilibrium by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can provide a computational route to characterize fragment binding, but this approach is so computationally intensive that it has thus far remained relatively unexplored. Here, we perform MD simulations of sufficient length to observe several different fragments spontaneously and repeatedly bind to and unbind from the protein FKBP, allowing the binding affinities, on- and off-rates, and relative occupancies of alternative binding sites and alternative poses within each binding site to be estimated, thereby illustrating the potential of long time scale MD as a quantitative tool for fragment-based drug discovery. The data from the long time scale fragment binding simulations reported here also provide a useful benchmark for testing alternative computational methods aimed at characterizing fragment binding properties. As an example, we calculated binding affinities for the same fragments using a standard free energy perturbation approach and found that the values agreed with those obtained from the fragment binding simulations within statistical error.},

abstract = {Allosteric drug development holds promise for delivering medicines that are more selective and less toxic than those that target orthosteric sites. To date, the discovery of allosteric binding sites and lead compounds has been mostly serendipitous, achieved through high-throughput screening. Over the past decade, structural data has become more readily available for larger protein systems and more membrane protein classes (e.g., GPCRs and ion channels), which are common allosteric drug targets. In parallel, improved simulation methods now provide better atomistic understanding of the protein dynamics and cooperative motions that are critical to allosteric mechanisms. As a result of these advances, the field of predictive allosteric drug development is now on the cusp of a new era of rational structure-based computational methods. Here, we review algorithms that predict allosteric sites based on sequence data and molecular dynamics simulations, describe tools that assess the druggability of these pockets, and discuss how Markov state models and topology analyses provide insight into the relationship between protein dynamics and allosteric drug binding. In each section, we first provide an overview of the various method classes before describing relevant algorithms and software packages.},

abstract = {Accurate mechanistic description of structural changes in biomolecules is an increasingly important topic in structural and chemical biology. Markov models have emerged as a powerful way to approximate the molecular kinetics of large biomolecules while keeping full structural resolution in a divide-and-conquer fashion. However, the accuracy of these models is limited by that of the force fields used to generate the underlying molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. Whereas the quality of classical MD force fields has improved significantly in recent years, remaining errors in the Boltzmann weights are still on the order of a few [Formula: see text], which may lead to significant discrepancies when comparing to experimentally measured rates or state populations. Here we take the view that simulations using a sufficiently good force-field sample conformations that are valid but have inaccurate weights, yet these weights may be made accurate by incorporating experimental data a posteriori. To do so, we propose augmented Markov models (AMMs), an approach that combines concepts from probability theory and information theory to consistently treat systematic force-field error and statistical errors in simulation and experiment. Our results demonstrate that AMMs can reconcile conflicting results for protein mechanisms obtained by different force fields and correct for a wide range of stationary and dynamical observables even when only equilibrium measurements are incorporated into the estimation process. This approach constitutes a unique avenue to combine experiment and computation into integrative models of biomolecular structure and dynamics.},

abstract = {Allostery is a process by which proteins transmit the effect of perturbation at one site to a distal functional site upon certain perturbation. As an intrinsically global effect of protein dynamics, it is difficult to associate protein allostery with individual residues, hindering effective selection of key residues for mutagenesis studies. The machine learning models including decision tree (DT) and artificial neural network (ANN) models were applied to develop classification model for a cell signaling allosteric protein with two states showing extremely similar tertiary structures in both crystallographic structures and molecular dynamics simulations. Both DT and ANN models were developed with 75% and 80% of predicting accuracy, respectively. Good agreement between machine learning models and previous experimental as well as computational studies of the same protein validates this approach as an alternative way to analyze protein dynamics simulations and allostery. In addition, the difference of distributions of key features in two allosteric states also underlies the population shift hypothesis of dynamics-driven allostery model. {\textcopyright} 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Most allosteric studies have focused on thermodynamic properties, in particular, substrate binding affinity. Changes in substrate binding affinity by allosteric effectors have generally been thought to be mediated by conformational transitions of the proteins or, alternatively, by changes in the broadness of the free energy basin of the protein conformational state without shifting the basin minimum position. When effector binding changes the free energy landscape of a protein in conformational space, the change affects not only thermodynamic properties but also dynamic properties, including the amplitudes of motions on different time scales and rates of conformational transitions.

Using the M(3) muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3R)-Galpha(q) system as a model system, we examined the ability of approximately 250 combinations of cysteine-substituted M3R and Galpha(q) proteins to undergo cross-link formation. We identified many specific M3R-Galpha(q) contact sites, in both the inactive and active receptor conformations, allowing us to draw conclusions regarding the basic architecture of the M3R-Galpha(q) interface and the nature of the conformational changes following receptor activation. As heterotrimeric G proteins as well as most GPCRs share a high degree of structural homology, our findings should be of broad general relevance.},

abstract = {A new statistical thermodynamic formalism has been developed in order to describe the equilibrium folding pathway of proteins. The resulting formalism allows calculation of the probabilities that individual amino acid residues will be in a native or native-like conformation for any given degree of folding of the protein molecule. The residue probabilities are defined by the probability distribution of conformational states and can be used to calculate experimental quantities like native-state, hydrogen exchange protection factors. A combinatorial algorithm aimed at generating a large ensemble of conformational states (10(4) to 10(6)) using the native structure as a template has been developed. The Gibbs energy and corresponding probability of each conformational state is estimated by using a previously developed structural parametrization of the energetics. The approach has been applied to five different proteins: hen egg-white lysozyme, equine lysozyme, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, staphylococcal nuclease and turkey ovomucoid third domain. The validity of the approach has been tested by comparing predicted and experimental hydrogen exchange protection factors. It is shown that for the above proteins 76%, 73%, 74%, 78% and 81% of all observed protection factors are predicted correctly. Furthermore, on average, the magnitude of the predicted protection factors, expressed as apparent free energies per residue deviate less than 1 kcal/mol from those obtained experimentally. These results represent the first attempt at predicting both the location and magnitude of hydrogen exchange protection factors from the high-resolution structure of a protein. The good agreement between experimental and predicted values has permitted a close examination of the nature of the equilibrium folding intermediates existing under conditions of maximal stability of the native state.},

The current model explaining the gain-of-function activity of the R201 mutations is through the loss of GTPase activity and resulting inability to switch off to the GDP state. Here, we find that the R201C mutation can bypass the need for GTP binding by directly activating GDP-bound G$\alpha$s through stabilization of an intramolecular hydrogen bond network. Having found that a gain-of-function mutation can convert GDP into an activator, we postulated that a reciprocal mutation might disrupt the normal role of GTP. Indeed, we found R228C, a loss-of-function mutation in G$\alpha$s that causes pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a (PHP-Ia), compromised the adenylyl cyclase-activating activity of G$\alpha$s bound to a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog. These findings show that disease-causing mutations in G$\alpha$s can subvert the canonical roles of GDP and GTP, providing new insights into the regulation mechanism of G proteins.},

Despite the crucial role of this process in cell signaling, little is known about the mechanism of G protein activation. Here we explore the structural basis for receptor-mediated GDP release using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Binding to the activated receptor (R*) causes an apparent rigid-body movement of the alpha5 helix of G alpha that would perturb GDP binding at the beta6-alpha5 loop. This movement was not observed when a flexible loop was inserted between the alpha5 helix and the R*-binding C terminus, which uncouples R* binding from nucleotide exchange, suggesting that this movement is necessary for GDP release. These data provide the first direct observation of R*-mediated conformational changes in G proteins and define the structural basis for GDP release from G alpha.},

abstract = {The holographic principle states that on a fundamental level the information content of a region should depend on its surface area rather than on its volume. In this Letter we show that this phenomenon not only emerges in the search for new Planck-scale laws but also in lattice models of classical and quantum physics: the information contained in part of a system in thermal equilibrium obeys an area law. While the maximal information per unit area depends classically only on the number of degrees of freedom, it may diverge as the inverse temperature in quantum systems. It is shown that an area law is generally implied by a finite correlation length when measured in terms of the mutual information.},

abstract = {The overall motions and atomic fluctuations of DHFR are calculated using molecular dynamics simulations to explore potential links between catalysis and dynamics in this enzyme system. Calculations of 10 ns duration were performed on three ternary complexes from the DHFR catalytic cycle:  DHFR/DHF/NADPH (DH), DHFR/THF/NADP+ (TP), and DHFR/THF/NADPH (TH). The protein maintains a core structure very similar to the initial X-ray model, while several flexible loops undergo conformational changes. Comparison of the dynamics of the protein in the different complexes demonstrates that the ligands affect the behavior of the protein even though the ligands only differ by one to two hydrogen atoms. In particular, strong-coupled motions that appear in the reactive complex DH disappear in the product complexes, indicating that these motions may be linked to catalysis.

BACKGROUND:The Avogadro project has developed an advanced molecule editor and visualizer designed for cross-platform use in computational chemistry, molecular modeling, bioinformatics, materials science, and related areas. It offers flexible, high quality rendering, and a powerful plugin architecture. Typical uses include building molecular structures, formatting input files, and analyzing output of a wide variety of computational chemistry packages. By using the CML file format as its native document type, Avogadro seeks to enhance the semantic accessibility of chemical data types.

RESULTS:The work presented here details the Avogadro library, which is a framework providing a code library and application programming interface (API) with three-dimensional visualization capabilities; and has direct applications to research and education in the fields of chemistry, physics, materials science, and biology. The Avogadro application provides a rich graphical interface using dynamically loaded plugins through the library itself. The application and library can each be extended by implementing a plugin module in C++ or Python to explore different visualization techniques, build/manipulate molecular structures, and interact with other programs. We describe some example extensions, one which uses a genetic algorithm to find stable crystal structures, and one which interfaces with the PackMol program to create packed, solvated structures for molecular dynamics simulations. The 1.0 release series of Avogadro is the main focus of the results discussed here.

CONCLUSIONS:Avogadro offers a semantic chemical builder and platform for visualization and analysis. For users, it offers an easy-to-use builder, integrated support for downloading from common databases such as PubChem and the Protein Data Bank, extracting chemical data from a wide variety of formats, including computational chemistry output, and native, semantic support for the CML file format. For developers, it can be easily extended via a powerful plugin mechanism to support new features in organic chemistry, inorganic complexes, drug design, materials, biomolecules, and simulations.

Here, based on a detailed analysis of protein structures deposited in the protein data bank, as well as on state-of-the art molecular simulations, we provide general evidence for the transfer of structural information by correlated backbone motions, mediated by hydrogen bonds, across $\beta$-sheets. We also show that the observed local and long-range correlated motions are mediated by the collective motions of $\beta$-sheets and investigate their role in large-scale conformational changes. Correlated motions represent a fundamental property of $\beta$-sheets that contributes to protein function.},

abstract = {K-Ras is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancers, but there are still no drugs that directly target it in the clinic. Recent studies utilizing dynamics information show promising results for selectively targeting mutant K-Ras. However, despite extensive characterization, the mechanisms by which K-Ras residue fluctuations transfer allosteric regulatory information remain unknown. Understanding the direction of information flow can provide new mechanistic insights for K-Ras targeting. Here, we present a novel approach -conditional time-delayed correlations (CTC) - using the motions of all residue pairs of a protein to predict directionality in the allosteric regulation of the protein fluctuations. Analyzing nucleotide-dependent intrinsic K-Ras motions with the new approach yields predictions that agree with the literature, showing that GTP-binding stabilizes K-Ras motions and leads to residue correlations with relatively long characteristic decay times. Furthermore, our study is the first to identify driver-follower relationships in correlated motions of K-Ras residue pairs, revealing the direction of information flow during allosteric modulation of its nucleotide-dependent intrinsic activity: active K-Ras Switch-II region motions drive Switch-I region motions, while $\alpha$-helix-3L7 motions control both. Our results provide novel insights for strategies that directly target mutant K-Ras.},

abstract = {Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has recently enabled high-resolution structure determination of numerous biological macromolecular complexes. Despite this progress, the application of high-resolution cryo-EM to G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in complex with heterotrimeric G proteins remains challenging, owning to both the relative small size and the limited stability of these assemblies. Here we describe the development of antibody fragments that bind and stabilize GPCR-G protein complexes for the application of high-resolution cryo-EM. One antibody in particular, mAb16, stabilizes GPCR/G-protein complexes by recognizing an interface between G$\alpha$ and G$\beta$$\gamma$ subunits in the heterotrimer, and confers resistance to GTP$\gamma$S-triggered dissociation. The unique recognition mode of this antibody makes it possible to transfer its binding and stabilizing effect to other G-protein subtypes through minimal protein engineering. This antibody fragment is thus a broadly applicable tool for structural studies of GPCR/G-protein complexes.},

abstract = {The problem of spontaneous folding of amino acid chains into highly organized, biologically functional three-dimensional protein structures continues to challenge the modern science. Understanding how proteins fold requires characterization of the underlying energy landscapes as well as the dynamics of the polypeptide chains in all stages of the folding process. In recent years, important advances toward these goals have been achieved owing to the rapidly growing interdisciplinary interest and significant progress in both experimental techniques and theoretical methods. Improvements in the experimental time resolution led to determination of the timescales of the important elementary events in folding, such as formation of secondary structure and tertiary contacts. Sensitive single molecule methods made possible probing the distributions of the unfolded and folded states and following the folding reaction of individual protein molecules. Discovery of proteins that fold in microseconds opened the possibility of atomic-level theoretical simulations of folding and their direct comparisons with experimental data, as well as of direct experimental observation of the barrier-less folding transition. The ultra-fast folding also brought new questions, concerning the intrinsic limits of the folding rates and experimental signatures of barrier-less "downhill" folding. These problems will require novel approaches for even more detailed experimental investigations of the folding dynamics as well as for the analysis of the folding kinetic data. For theoretical simulations of folding, a main challenge is how to extract the relevant information from overwhelmingly detailed atomistic trajectories. New theoretical methods have been devised to allow a systematic approach towards a quantitative analysis of the kinetic network of folding-unfolding transitions between various configuration states of a protein, revealing the transition states and the associated folding pathways at multiple levels, from atomistic to coarse-grained representations.

abstract = {Many adverse drug reactions are thought to be caused by electrophilically reactive drug metabolites that conjugate to nucleophilic sites within DNA and proteins, causing cancer or toxic immune responses. Quinone species, including quinone-imines, quinone-methides, and imine-methides, are electrophilic Michael acceptors that are often highly reactive and comprise over 40% of all known reactive metabolites. Quinone metabolites are created by cytochromes P450 and peroxidases. For example, cytochromes P450 oxidize acetaminophen to N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, which is electrophilically reactive and covalently binds to nucleophilic sites within proteins. This reactive quinone metabolite elicits a toxic immune response when acetaminophen exceeds a safe dose. Using a deep learning approach, this study reports the first published method for predicting quinone formation: the formation of a quinone species by metabolic oxidation. We model both one- and two-step quinone formation, enabling accurate quinone formation predictions in nonobvious cases. We predict atom pairs that form quinones with an AUC accuracy of 97.6%, and we identify molecules that form quinones with 88.2% AUC. By modeling the formation of quinones, one of the most common types of reactive metabolites, our method provides a rapid screening tool for a key drug toxicity risk. The XenoSite quinone formation model is available at http://swami.wustl.edu/xenosite/p/quinone .},

abstract = {CONSPECTUS: Protein function is inextricably linked to protein dynamics. As we move from a static structural picture to a dynamic ensemble view of protein structure and function, novel computational paradigms are required for observing and understanding conformational dynamics of proteins and its functional implications. In principle, molecular dynamics simulations can provide the time evolution of atomistic models of proteins, but the long time scales associated with functional dynamics make it difficult to observe rare dynamical transitions. The issue of extracting essential functional components of protein dynamics from noisy simulation data presents another set of challenges in obtaining an unbiased understanding of protein motions. Therefore, a methodology that provides a statistical framework for efficient sampling and a human-readable view of the key aspects of functional dynamics from data analysis is required. The Markov state model (MSM), which has recently become popular worldwide for studying protein dynamics, is an example of such a framework. In this Account, we review the use of Markov state models for efficient sampling of the hierarchy of time scales associated with protein dynamics, automatic identification of key conformational states, and the degrees of freedom associated with slow dynamical processes. Applications of MSMs for studying long time scale phenomena such as activation mechanisms of cellular signaling proteins has yielded novel insights into protein function. In particular, from MSMs built using large-scale simulations of GPCRs and kinases, we have shown that complex conformational changes in proteins can be described in terms of structural changes in key structural motifs or "molecular switches" within the protein, the transitions between functionally active and inactive states of proteins proceed via multiple pathways, and ligand or substrate binding modulates the flux through these pathways. Finally, MSMs also provide a theoretical toolbox for studying the effect of nonequilibrium perturbations on conformational dynamics. Considering that protein dynamics in vivo occur under nonequilibrium conditions, MSMs coupled with nonequilibrium statistical mechanics provide a way to connect cellular components to their functional environments. Nonequilibrium perturbations of protein folding MSMs reveal the presence of dynamically frozen glass-like states in their conformational landscape. These frozen states are also observed to be rich in $\beta$-sheets, which indicates their possible role in the nucleation of $\beta$-sheet rich aggregates such as those observed in amyloid-fibril formation. Finally, we describe how MSMs have been used to understand the dynamical behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins such as amyloid-$\beta$, human islet amyloid polypeptide, and p53. While certainly not a panacea for studying functional dynamics, MSMs provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for understanding complex entropically dominated processes and a convenient lens for viewing protein motions.},

Here we report that the plant-derived depsipeptide FR900359 (FR) is ideally suited to this task. Using a multifaceted approach we systematically characterize FR as a selective inhibitor of Gq/11/14 over all other mammalian G$\alpha$ isoforms and elaborate its molecular mechanism of action. We also use FR to investigate whether inhibition of Gq proteins is an effective post-receptor strategy to target oncogenic signalling, using melanoma as a model system. FR suppresses many of the hallmark features that are central to the malignancy of melanoma cells, thereby providing new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Just as pertussis toxin is used extensively to probe and inhibit the signalling of Gi/o proteins, we anticipate that FR will at least be its equivalent for investigating the biological relevance of Gq.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can model the interactions between macromolecules with high spatiotemporal resolution but at a high computational cost. By combining high-throughput MD with Markov state models (MSMs), it is now possible to obtain long time-scale behavior of small to intermediate biomolecules and complexes. To model the interactions of many molecules at large length scales, particle-based reaction-diffusion (RD) simulations are more suitable but lack molecular detail. Thus, coupling MSMs and RD simulations (MSM/RD) would be highly desirable, as they could efficiently produce simulations at large time and length scales, while still conserving the characteristic features of the interactions observed at atomic detail. While such a coupling seems straightforward, fundamental questions are still open: Which definition of MSM states is suitable? Which protocol to merge and split RD particles in an association/dissociation reaction will conserve the correct bimolecular kinetics and thermodynamics? In this paper, we make the first step toward MSM/RD by laying out a general theory of coupling and proposing a first implementation for association/dissociation of a protein with a small ligand (A + B ⇌ C). Applications on a toy model and CO diffusion into the heme cavity of myoglobin are reported.},

abstract = {Visual rhodopsins are recognized members of the large and diverse family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), but their evolutionary origin and relationships to other proteins are not known. In a previous paper [Shlykov MA, Zheng WH, Chen JS {\&} Saier MH Jr (2012) Biochim Biophys Acta 1818, 703-717], we characterized the 4-toluene sulfonate uptake permease (TSUP) family of transmembrane proteins, and showed that these 7-transmembrane segment (TMS) or 8-TMS proteins arose by intragenic duplication of a gene encoding a 4-TMS protein, sometimes followed by loss of a terminal TMS. In this study, we show that the TSUP, GPCR and microbial rhodopsin families are related to each other and to six other currently recognized transport protein families. We designate this superfamily the transporter/opsin/G protein-coupled receptor (TOG) superfamily. Despite their 8-TMS origins, the members of most constituent families exhibit 7-TMS topologies that are well conserved, and these arose by loss of either the N-terminal TMS (more frequent) or the C-terminal TMS (less frequent), depending on the family. Phylogenetic analyses revealed familial relationships within the superfamily and protein relationships within each of the nine families. The results of the statistical analyses leading to the conclusion of homology were confirmed using hidden Markov models, Pfam and 3D superimpositions. Proteins functioning by dissimilar mechanisms (channels, primary active transporters, secondary active transporters, group translocators and receptors) are interspersed on a phylogenetic tree of the TOG superfamily, suggesting that changes in the transport and energy-coupling mechanisms occurred multiple times during evolution of this superfamily.},

abstract = {The biological activities of Rho family GTPases are controlled by their guanine nucleotide binding states in cells. Here we have investigated the role of Mg(2+) cofactor in the guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis processes of the Rho family members, Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA. Differing from Ras and Rab proteins, which require Mg(2+) for GDP and GTP binding, the Rho GTPases bind the nucleotides in the presence or absence of Mg(2+) similarly, with dissociation constants in the submicromolar concentration. The presence of Mg(2+), however, resulted in a marked decrease in the intrinsic dissociation rates of the nucleotides. The catalytic activity of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) appeared to be negatively regulated by free Mg(2+), and GEF binding to Rho GTPase resulted in a 10-fold decrease in affinity for Mg(2+), suggesting that one role of GEF is to displace bound Mg(2+) from the Rho proteins. The GDP dissociation rates of the GTPases could be further stimulated by GEF upon removal of bound Mg(2+), indicating that the GEF-catalyzed nucleotide exchange involves a Mg(2+)-independent as well as a Mg(2+)-dependent mechanism. Although Mg(2+) is not absolutely required for GTP hydrolysis by the Rho GTPases, the divalent ion apparently participates in the GTPase reaction, since the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rates were enhanced 4-10-fold upon binding to Mg(2+), and k(cat) values of the Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP)-catalyzed reactions were significantly increased when Mg(2+) was present. Furthermore, the p50RhoGAP specificity for Cdc42 was lost in the absence of Mg(2+) cofactor. These studies directly demonstrate a role of Mg(2+) in regulating the kinetics of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis and in the GEF- and GAP-catalyzed reactions of Rho family GTPases. The results suggest that GEF facilitates nucleotide exchange by destabilizing both bound nucleotide and Mg(2+), whereas RhoGAP utilizes the Mg(2+) cofactor to achieve high catalytic efficiency and specificity.},

abstract = {Modern protein crystal structures are based nearly exclusively on X-ray data collected at cryogenic temperatures (generally 100~K). The cooling process is thought to introduce little bias in the functional interpretation of structural results, because cryogenic temperatures minimally perturb the overall protein backbone fold. In contrast, here we show that flash cooling biases previously hidden structural ensembles in protein crystals. By analyzing available data for 30 different proteins using new computational tools for electron-density sampling, model refinement, and molecular packing analysis, we found that crystal cryocooling remodels the conformational distributions of more than 35% of side chains and eliminates packing defects necessary for functional motions. In the signaling switch protein, H-Ras, an allosteric network consistent with fluctuations detected in solution by NMR was uncovered in the room-temperature, but not the cryogenic, electron-density maps. These results expose a bias in structural databases toward smaller, overpacked, and unrealistically unique models. Monitoring room-temperature conformational ensembles by X-ray crystallography can reveal motions crucial for catalysis, ligand binding, and allosteric regulation.},

abstract = {We propose a thermodynamic interpretation of transfer entropy near equilibrium, using a specialised Boltzmann{\textquoteright}s principle. The approach relates conditional probabilities to the probabilities of the corresponding state transitions. This in turn characterises transfer entropy as a difference of two entropy rates: the rate for a resultant transition and another rate for a possibly irreversible transition within the system affected by an additional source. We then show that this difference, the local transfer entropy, is proportional to the external entropy production, possibly due to irreversibility. Near equilibrium, transfer entropy is also interpreted as the difference in equilibrium stabilities with respect to two scenarios: a default case and the case with an additional source. Finally, we demonstrated that such a thermodynamic treatment is not applicable to information flow, a measure of causal effect.},

abstract = {Ligand binding can change the pKa of protein residues and influence enzyme catalysis. Herein, we report three ultrahigh resolution X-ray crystal structures of CTX-M $\beta$-lactamase, directly visualizing protonation state changes along the enzymatic pathway: apo protein at 0.79 {\AA}, precovalent complex with nonelectrophilic ligand at 0.89 {\AA}, and acylation transition state (TS) analogue at 0.84 {\AA}. Binding of the noncovalent ligand induces a proton transfer from the catalytic Ser70 to the negatively charged Glu166, and the formation of a low-barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB) between Ser70 and Lys73, with a length of 2.53 {\AA} and the shared hydrogen equidistant from the heteroatoms. QM/MM reaction path calculations determined the proton transfer barrier to be 1.53 kcal/mol. The LBHB is absent in the other two structures although Glu166 remains neutral in the covalent complex. Our data represents the first X-ray crystallographic example of a hydrogen engaged in an enzymatic LBHB, and demonstrates that desolvation of the active site by ligand binding can provide a protein microenvironment conducive to LBHB formation. It also suggests that LBHBs may contribute to stabilization of the TS in general acid/base catalysis together with other preorganized features of enzyme active sites. These structures reconcile previous experimental results suggesting alternatively Glu166 or Lys73 as the general base for acylation, and underline the importance of considering residue protonation state change when modeling protein-ligand interactions. Additionally, the observation of another LBHB (2.47 {\AA}) between two conserved residues, Asp233 and Asp246, suggests that LBHBs may potentially play a special structural role in proteins. },

abstract = {Transcription factors and other allosteric cell signaling proteins contain a disproportionate number of domains or segments that are intrinsically disordered (ID) under native conditions. In many cases folding of these segments is coupled to binding with one or more of their interaction partners, suggesting that intrinsic disorder plays an important functional role. Despite numerous hypotheses for the role of ID domains in regulation, a mechanistic model has yet to be established that can quantitatively assess the importance of intrinsic disorder for intramolecular site-to-site communication, the hallmark property of allosteric proteins. Here, we present such a model and show that site-to-site allosteric coupling is maximized when intrinsic disorder is present in the domains or segments containing one or both of the coupled binding sites. This result not only explains the prevalence of ID domains in regulatory proteins, it also calls into question the classical mechanical view of energy propagation in proteins, which predicts that site-to-site coupling would be maximized when a well defined pathway of folded structure connects the two sites. Furthermore, in showing that the coupling mechanism conferred by intrinsic disorder is robust and independent of the network of interactions that physically link the coupled sites, unique insights are gained into the energetic ground rules that govern site-to-site communication in all proteins.},

abstract = {Natural genetic variation in the human genome is a cause of individual differences in responses to medications and is an underappreciated burden on public health. Although 108 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the targets of 475 (∼34%) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and account for a global sales volume of over 180 billion US dollars annually, the prevalence of genetic variation among GPCRs targeted by drugs is unknown. By analyzing data from 68,496 individuals, we find that GPCRs targeted by drugs show genetic variation within functional regions such as drug- and effector-binding sites in the human population. We experimentally show that certain variants of $\mu$-opioid and Cholecystokinin-A receptors could lead to altered or adverse drug response. By analyzing UK National Health Service drug prescription and sales data, we suggest that characterizing GPCR variants could increase prescription precision, improving patients' quality of life, and relieve the economic and societal burden due to variable drug responsiveness.

abstract = {Proteins are dynamic molecules that undergo conformational changes to a broad spectrum of different excited states. Unfortunately, the small populations of these states make it difficult to determine their structures or functional implications. Computer simulations are an increasingly powerful means to identify and characterize functionally relevant excited states. However, this advance has uncovered a further challenge: it can be extremely difficult to identify the most salient features of large simulation data sets. We reasoned that many functionally relevant conformational changes are likely to involve large, cooperative changes to the surfaces that are available to interact with potential binding partners. To examine this hypothesis, we introduce a method that returns a prioritized list of potentially functional conformational changes by segmenting protein structures into clusters of residues that undergo cooperative changes in their solvent exposure, along with the hierarchy of interactions between these groups. We term these groups exposons to distinguish them from other types of clusters that arise in this analysis and others. We demonstrate, using three different model systems, that this method identifies experimentally validated and functionally relevant conformational changes, including conformational switches, allosteric coupling, and cryptic pockets. Our results suggest that key functional sites are hubs in the network of exposons. As a further test of the predictive power of this approach, we apply it to discover cryptic allosteric sites in two different $\beta$-lactamase enzymes that are widespread sources of antibiotic resistance. Experimental tests confirm our predictions for both systems. Importantly, we provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, for a cryptic allosteric site in CTX-M-9 $\beta$-lactamase. Experimentally testing this prediction did not require any mutations and revealed that this site exerts the most potent allosteric control over activity of any pockets found in $\beta$-lactamases to date. Discovery of a similar pocket that was previously overlooked in the well-studied TEM-1 $\beta$-lactamase demonstrates the utility of exposons.},

abstract = {Allostery involves coupling of conformational changes between two widely separated binding sites. The common view holds that allosteric proteins are symmetric oligomers, with each subunit existing in "at least" two conformational states with a different affinity for ligands. Recent observations such as the allosteric behavior of myoglobin, a classical example of a nonallosteric protein, call into question the existing allosteric dogma. Here we argue that all (nonfibrous) proteins are potentially allosteric. Allostery is a consequence of re-distributions of protein conformational ensembles. In a nonallosteric protein, the binding site shape may not show a concerted second-site change and enzyme kinetics may not reflect an allosteric transition. Nevertheless, appropriate ligands, point mutations, or external conditions may facilitate a population shift, leading a presumably nonallosteric protein to behave allosterically. In principle, practically any potential drug binding to the protein surface can alter the conformational redistribution. The question is its effectiveness in the redistribution of the ensemble, affecting the protein binding sites and its function. Here, we review experimental observations validating this view of protein allostery.},

abstract = {The chemical mechanism of the 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (EC 1.3.1.34) from rat liver mitochondria has been investigated. This enzyme catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of 2,4-dienoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) thiolesters to the resulting trans-3-enoyl-CoA. Steady-state kinetic parameters for trans-2,trans-4-hexadienoyl-CoA and 5-phenyl-trans-2,trans-4-pentadienoyl-CoA were determined and demonstrated that the dienoyl-CoA and NADPH bind to the 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase via a sequential kinetic mechanism. Kinetic isotope effect studies and the transient kinetics of substrate binding support a random order of nucleotide and dienoyl-CoA addition. The large normal solvent isotope effects on V/K ((D)(2)(O)V/K) and V ((D)(2)(O)V) for trans-2,trans-4-hexadienoyl-CoA reduction indicate that a proton transfer step is rate limiting for this substrate. The stability gained by conjugating the phenyl ring to the diene in PPD-CoA results in the reversal of the rate-determining step, as evidenced by the normal isotope effects on V/K(CoA) ((D)V/K(CoA)) and V/K(NADPH) ((D)V/K(NADPH)). The reversal of the rate-determining step was supported by transient kinetics where a burst was observed for the reduction of trans-2,trans-4-hexadienoyl-CoA but not for 5-phenyl-trans-2,trans-4-pentadienoyl-CoA reduction. The chemical mechanism is stepwise where hydride transfer from NADPH occurs followed by protonation of the observable dienolate intermediate, which has an absorbance maximum at 286 nm. The exchange of the C alpha protons of trans-3-decenoyl-CoA, catalyzed by the 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, in the presence of NADP(+) suggests that formation of the dienolate is catalyzed by the enzyme active site.},

abstract = {K-Ras is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancers, but there are still no drugs that directly target it in the clinic. Recent studies utilizing dynamics information show promising results for selectively targeting mutant K-Ras. However, despite extensive characterization, the mechanisms by which K-Ras residue fluctuations transfer allosteric regulatory information remain unknown. Understanding the direction of information flow can provide new mechanistic insights for K-Ras targeting. Here, we present a novel approach -conditional time-delayed correlations (CTC) - using the motions of all residue pairs of a protein to predict directionality in the allosteric regulation of the protein fluctuations. Analyzing nucleotide-dependent intrinsic K-Ras motions with the new approach yields predictions that agree with the literature, showing that GTP-binding stabilizes K-Ras motions and leads to residue correlations with relatively long characteristic decay times. Furthermore, our study is the first to identify driver-follower relationships in correlated motions of K-Ras residue pairs, revealing the direction of information flow during allosteric modulation of its nucleotide-dependent intrinsic activity: active K-Ras Switch-II region motions drive Switch-I region motions, while $\alpha$-helix-3L7 motions control both. Our results provide novel insights for strategies that directly target mutant K-Ras.},

abstract = {The Surflex flexible molecular docking method has been generalized and extended in two primary areas related to the search component of docking. First, incorporation of a small-molecule force-field extends the search into Cartesian coordinates constrained by internal ligand energetics. Whereas previous versions searched only the alignment and acyclic torsional space of the ligand, the new approach supports dynamic ring flexibility and all-atom optimization of docked ligand poses. Second, knowledge of well established molecular interactions between ligand fragments and a target protein can be directly exploited to guide the search process. This offers advantages in some cases over the search strategy where ligand alignment is guided solely by a "protomol" (a pre-computed molecular representation of an idealized ligand). Results are presented on both docking accuracy and screening utility using multiple publicly available benchmark data sets that place Surflex's performance in the context of other molecular docking methods. In terms of docking accuracy, Surflex-Dock 2.1 performs as well as the best available methods. In the area of screening utility, Surflex's performance is extremely robust, and it is clearly superior to other methods within the set of cases for which comparative data are available, with roughly double the screening enrichment performance.},

abstract = {<p>Class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) influence virtually every aspect of human physiology. GPCR activation is an allosteric process that links agonist binding to G protein recruitment, with the hallmark outward movement of transmembrane helix 6 (TM6). However, what leads to TM6 movement and the key residue-level changes of this trigger remain less well understood. Here, by analyzing over 230 high-resolution structures of class A GPCRs, we discovered a modular, universal GPCR activation pathway that unites previous findings into a common activation mechanism, directly linking the bottom of ligand-binding pocket with G protein-coupling region. We suggest that the modular nature of the universal GPCR activation pathway allowed for the decoupling of the evolution of the ligand binding site, G protein binding region and the residues important for receptor activation. Such an architecture might have facilitated GPCRs to emerge as a highly successful family of proteins for signal transduction in nature.</p>},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are essential for transferring extracellular signals into carefully choreographed intracellular responses controlling diverse aspects of cell physiology. The duration of GPCR mediated signaling is primarily regulated via GPCR kinase (GRK)-mediated phosphorylation of activated receptors. Although many GRK structures have been reported, the mechanisms underlying GRK activation are not well understood, in part because it is unknown how these structures map to the conformational landscape available to this enzyme family. Unlike most other AGC kinases, GRKs rely on their interaction with GPCRs for activation and not phosphorylation. Here, we used principal component analysis of available GRK and protein kinase A crystal structures to identify their dominant domain motions and to provide a framework that helps evaluate how close each GRK structure is a catalytically competent state. Our results indicated that disruption of an interface formed between the large lobe of the kinase domain and the regulator of G protein signaling homology domain (RHD) is highly correlated with establishment of the active conformation. By introducing point mutations in the GRK5 RHD-kinase domain interface, we show with both in silico and in vitro experiments that perturbation of this interface leads to higher phosphorylation activity. Navigation of the conformational landscape defined by this bioinformatics-based study is likely common to all GPCR-activated GRKs.},

abstract = {Gene networks with feedback often involve interactions between multiple species of biomolecules, much more than experiments can actually monitor. Coupled with this is the challenge that experiments often measure gene expression in noisy fluorescence instead of protein numbers. How do we infer biophysical information and characterize the underlying circuits from this limited and convoluted data? We address this by building stochastic models using the principle of Maximum Caliber (MaxCal). MaxCal uses the basic information on synthesis, degradation, and feedback-without invoking any other auxiliary species and ad hoc reactions-to generate stochastic trajectories similar to those typically measured in experiments. MaxCal in conjunction with Maximum Likelihood (ML) can infer parameters of the model using fluctuating trajectories of protein expression over time. We demonstrate the success of the MaxCal + ML methodology using synthetic data generated from known circuits of different genetic switches: (i) a single-gene autoactivating circuit involving five species (including mRNA), (ii) a mutually repressing two-gene circuit (toggle switch) with seven species (including mRNA) considering stochastic time traces of two proteins, and (iii) the same toggle switch circuit considering stochastic time traces of only one of the two proteins. To further challenge the MaxCal + ML inference scheme, we repeat our analysis for the second and third scenario with traces expressed in noisy fluorescence instead of protein number to closely mimic typical experiments. We show that, for all of these models with increasing complexity and obfuscation, the minimal model of MaxCal is still able to capture the fluctuations of the trajectory and infer basic underlying rate parameters when benchmarked against the known values used to generate the synthetic data. Importantly, the model also yields an effective feedback parameter that can be used to quantify interactions within these circuits. These applications show the promise of MaxCal's ability to characterize circuits with limited data, and its utility to better understand evolution and advance design strategies for specific functions.},

X-ray structures with protein nanobodies give good agreement between the assigned activation state and the predictions of the model, whereby many active nanobody structures are predicted to be weakly active.

abstract = {Heterotrimeric G proteins are fundamental signaling proteins composed of three subunits, G$\alpha$ and a G$\beta$$\gamma$ dimer. The role of G$\alpha$ as a molecular switch is critical for transmitting and amplifying intracellular signaling cascades initiated by an activated G protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR). Despite their biochemical and therapeutic importance, the study of G protein evolution has been limited to the scope of a few model organisms. Furthermore, of the five primary G$\alpha$ subfamilies, the underlying gene structure of only two families has been thoroughly investigated outside of Mammalia evolution. Therefore our understanding of G$\alpha$ emergence and evolution across phylogeny remains incomplete. We have computationally identified the presence and absence of every G$\alpha$ gene (GNA-) across all major branches of Deuterostomia and evaluated the conservation of the underlying exon-intron structures across these phylogenetic groups. We provide evidence of mutually exclusive exon inclusion through alternative splicing in specific lineages. Variations of splice site conservation and isoforms were found for several paralogs which coincide with conserved, putative motifs of DNA-/RNA-binding proteins. In addition to our curated gene annotations, within Primates, we identified 15 retrotranspositions, many of which have undergone pseudogenization. Most importantly, we find numerous deviations from previous findings regarding the presence and absence of individual GNA- genes, nuanced differences in phyla-specific gene copy numbers, novel paralog duplications and subsequent intron gain and loss events. Our curated annotations allow us to draw more accurate inferences regarding the emergence of all G$\alpha$ family members across Metazoa and to present a new, updated theory of G$\alpha$ evolution. Leveraging this, our results are critical for gaining new insights into the co-evolution of the G$\alpha$ subunit and its many protein binding partners, especially therapeutically relevant G protein {\textendash} GPCR signaling pathways which radiated in Vertebrata evolution.},

abstract = {Olfaction is an ancient sensory system allowing an organism to detect chemicals in its environment. The first step in odor transduction is mediated by binding odorants to olfactory receptors (ORs) which belong to the heptahelical G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. Mammalian ORs are disposed in clusters on virtually all chromosomes. They are encoded by the largest multigene family (approximately 1000 members) in the genome of mammals and Caenorhabditis elegans, whereas Drosophila contains only 60 genes. Each OR specifically recognizes a set of odorous molecules that share common molecular features. In mammals, signal transduces through the G-protein-dependent signal pathway in the olfactory sensory neurons that synapse ultimately in the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb, and is finally processed in higher brain structures. The expression of a given OR conditions neuron and glomerulus choices. To date, the processes which monitor OR expression and axon wiring have emerged but are not completely elucidated.},

This is because they are involved in almost all facets of physiology, in many pathophysiological processes, they are tractable due to their cell surface location, and can exhibit highly textured pharmacology. While the development of new drugs does not require the molecular details of the mechanism of activity for a particular target, there has been increasing interest in the GPCR field in these details. In part, this has come with the recognition that differential activity at a particular target might be a way in which to leverage drug activity, either through manipulation of efficacy or through differential coupling (signaling bias). To this end, the past few years have seen a number of publications that have specifically attempted to address one or more aspects of the molecular reaction pathway, leading to activation of heterotrimeric G proteins by GPCRs.},

Solution-state NMR has provided the major contribution in that area of study during the past decade, despite nonoptimized labeling schemes due to the use of insect cells and, to a lesser extent, yeast as the main expression hosts. Indeed, the most efficient isotope-labeling scheme ever to address energy landscape issues for large proteins or protein complexes relies on the use of 13CH3 probes immersed in a perdeuterated dipolar environment, which is essentially out of reach of eukaryotic expression systems. In contrast, although its contribution has been underestimated because of technical issues, Escherichia coli is by far the best-adapted host for such labeling. As it is now tightly controlled, we show in this review that bacterial expression can provide an NMR spectral resolution never achieved in the GPCR field.},

abstract = {G proteins are active as long as GTP is bound to the alpha subunit. Activation ends when GTP is cleaved to GDP that then stays bound to the active site. Agonist-liganded receptors allow formation of the active state by decreasing the affinity of alpha subunits for GDP allowing exchange of GDP for GTP. Since receptors interact with the C terminus of the alpha subunits, we tested whether deletion of the C terminus could mimic activation by receptors. Three deletions and one point mutation at the C terminus of alpha o were engineered in alpha o cDNA by the polymerase chain reaction, transcribed into RNA, and translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The ability of in vitro synthesized protein to bind guanine nucleotide was inferred from analysis of native tryptic cleavage patterns, while the ability of the proteins to associate with beta gamma was measured by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Deletion of 14 amino acids, alpha oD[341], from the C terminus causes a large decrease in GDP affinity, with little or no change in guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate affinity. When GTP is present, alpha oD[341] remains in the activated conformation because exchange of GTP for GDP is rapid. Deletion of 10 amino acids, alpha oD[345], lowers GDP affinity, but less dramatically than in alpha oD[341]. Deletion of 5 amino acids, alpha oD[350], or mutation of Arg-349 to proline alpha oR[349P] has no detectable effects on GDP affinity. Deletion of up to 10 amino acids from the C terminus does not prevent formation of alpha beta gamma heterotrimers. We propose that the C terminus of the alpha subunit is a mobile region that blocks dissociation of GDP. Agonist-liganded receptors may move it aside to allow release of GDP, exchange for GTP, and activation of the alpha subunit.},

abstract = {The allosteric modulation of GPCRs by sodium (Na+) ions has drawn significant attention due to the availability of crystal structures of several receptors showing Na+ ions bound to the inactive conformations at the conserved Asp2.50. To date, structures from 24 families of GPCRs have been determined, though mechanistic insights into Na+ binding to the allosteric site are limited. We performed 100's of $\mu$s long simulations of 15 GPCRs and elucidated their Na+ binding mechanism. In class A GPCRs, Na+ ion binds to the conserved residue 2.50 whereas in class B, it binds at 3.43b, 6.53b and 7.49b. Using Markov state models, we obtained the free energy profiles and kinetics of Na+ binding to allosteric site, which shows a conserved mechanism of Na+ binding for GPCRs and reveals the residues that act as major barriers for ion diffusion. Furthermore, we also show that the Na+ ion could bind GPCRs from the intracellular side receptors with allosteric site inaccessible from extracellular side.},

abstract = {Allostery is a phenomenon that couples effector ligand binding at an allosteric site to a structural and/or dynamic change at a distant regulated site. To study an allosteric transition, we vary the size of the allosteric site and its interactions to construct a series of energy landscapes with pronounced minima corresponding to both the effector bound and unbound crystal structures. We use molecular dynamics to sample these landscapes. The degree of perturbation by the effector, modeled by the size of the allosteric site, provides an order parameter for allostery that allows us to determine how microscopic motions give rise to commonly discussed macroscopic mechanisms: (i) induced fit, (ii) population shift, and (iii) entropy driven. These mechanisms involve decreasing structural differences between the effector bound and unbound populations. A metric (ligand-induced cooperativity) can measure how cooperatively a given regulated site responds to effector binding and therefore what kind of allosteric mechanism is involved. We apply the model to three proteins with experimentally characterized transitions: (i) calmodulin-GFP Ca(2+) sensor protein, (ii) maltose binding protein, and (iii) CSL transcription factor. Remarkably, the model is able to reproduce allosteric motion and predict coupling in a manner consistent with experiment.},

Comparisons are made with experimental thermodynamic and structural data including the recent neutron diffraction results of Thiessen and Narten. The computed densities and potential energies are in reasonable accord with experiment except for the original BF model, which yields an 18% overestimate of the density and poor structural results. The TIPS2 and TIP4P potentials yield oxygen{\textendash}oxygen partial structure functions in good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The accord with the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is poorer; however, the computed results for these functions are similar for all the potential functions. Consequently, the discrepancy may be due to the correction terms needed in processing the neutron data or to an effect uniformly neglected in the computations. Comparisons are also made for self-diffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable structural and thermodynamic descriptions of liquid water and they should be useful in simulations of aqueous solutions. The simplicity of the SPC, TIPS2, and TIP4P functions is also attractive from a computational standpoint.},

abstract = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are seven transmembrane helix (TM) proteins that transduce signals into living cells by binding extracellular ligands and coupling to intracellular heterotrimeric G proteins (G$\alpha$$\beta$$\gamma$). The photoreceptor rhodopsin couples to transducin and bears its ligand 11-cis-retinal covalently bound via a protonated Schiff base to the opsin apoprotein. Absorption of a photon causes retinal cis/trans isomerization and generates the agonist all-trans-retinal in situ. After early photoproducts, the active G-protein-binding intermediate metarhodopsin II (Meta II) is formed, in which the retinal Schiff base is still intact but deprotonated. Dissociation of the proton from the Schiff base breaks a major constraint in the protein and enables further activating steps, including an outward tilt of TM6 and formation of a large cytoplasmic crevice for uptake of the interacting C terminus of the G$\alpha$ subunit. Owing to Schiff base hydrolysis, Meta II is short-lived and notoriously difficult to crystallize. We therefore soaked opsin crystals with all-trans-retinal to form Meta II, presuming that the crystal's high concentration of opsin in an active conformation (Ops*) may facilitate all-trans-retinal uptake and Schiff base formation. Here we present the 3.0 {\AA} and 2.85 {\AA} crystal structures, respectively, of Meta II alone or in complex with an 11-amino-acid C-terminal fragment derived from G$\alpha$ (G$\alpha$CT2). G$\alpha$CT2 binds in a large crevice at the cytoplasmic side, akin to the binding of a similar G$\alpha$-derived peptide to Ops* (ref. 7). In the Meta II structures, the electron density from the retinal ligand seamlessly continues into the Lys 296 side chain, reflecting proper formation of the Schiff base linkage. The retinal is in a relaxed conformation and almost undistorted compared with pure crystalline all-trans-retinal. By comparison with early photoproducts we propose how retinal translocation and rotation induce the gross conformational changes characteristic for Meta II. The structures can now serve as models for the large GPCR family.},

abstract = {Although allostery draws increasing attention, not much is known about allosteric mechanisms. Here we argue that in all proteins, allosteric signals transmit through multiple, pre-existing pathways; which pathways dominate depend on protein topologies, specific binding events, covalent modifications, and cellular (environmental) conditions. Further, perturbation events at any site on the protein surface (or in the interior) will not create new pathways but only shift the pre-existing ensemble of pathways. Drugs binding at different sites or mutational events in disease shift the ensemble toward the same conformations; however, the relative populations of the different states will change. Consequently the observed functional, conformational, and dynamic effects will be different. This is the origin of allosteric functional modulation in dynamic proteins: allostery does not necessarily need to invoke conformational rearrangements to control protein activity and pre-existing pathways are always defaulted to during allostery regardless of the stimulant and perturbation site in the protein.},

abstract = {The success of targeted covalent inhibitors in the global pharmaceutical industry has led to a resurgence of covalent drug discovery. However, covalent inhibitor design for flexible binding sites remains a difficult task due to a lack of methodological development. Here, we compared covalent docking to empirical electrophile screening against the highly dynamic target K-RasG12C. While the overall hit rate of both methods was comparable, we were able to rapidly progress a docking hit to a potent irreversible covalent binder that modifies the inactive, GDP-bound state of K-RasG12C. Hydrogen{\textendash}deuterium exchange mass spectrometry was used to probe the protein dynamics of compound binding to the switch-II pocket and subsequent destabilization of the nucleotide-binding region. SOS-mediated nucleotide exchange assays showed that, contrary to prior switch-II pocket inhibitors, these new compounds appear to accelerate nucleotide exchange. This study highlights the efficiency of covalent docking as a tool for the discovery of chemically novel hits against challenging targets.},

On the other hand, most scholars implicitly or explicitly assume that structural communities represent groups of nodes with similar (nontopological) properties or functions. This hypothesis could not be verified, so far, because of the lack of network datasets with information on the classification of the nodes. We show that traditional community detection methods fail to find the metadata groups in many large networks. Our results show that there is a marked separation between structural communities and metadata groups, in line with recent findings. That means that either our current modeling of community structure has to be substantially modified, or that metadata groups may not be recoverable from topology alone.},

abstract = {The Birch reduction of aromatic rings to cyclohexadiene compounds is widely used in chemical synthesis and requires solvated electrons, the most potent reductants known in organic chemistry. Benzoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) reductases (BCR) are key enzymes in the anaerobic bacterial degradation of aromatic compounds and catalyze an analogous reaction under physiological conditions. Class I BCRs are FeS enzymes and couple the reductive dearomatization of benzoyl-CoA to cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carboxyl-CoA (dienoyl-CoA) to a stoichiometric ATP hydrolysis. Here, we report on a tungsten-containing class II BCR from Geobacter metallireducens that catalyzed the fully reversible, ATP-independent dearomatization of benzoyl-CoA to dienoyl-CoA. BCR additionally catalyzed the disproportionation of dienoyl-CoA to benzoyl-CoA/monoenoyl-CoA and the four- and six-electron reduction of benzoyl-CoA in the presence of a reduced low-potential bridged 2,2{\textasciiacute}-bipyridyl redox dye.

abstract = {R1$\rho$ relaxation dispersion experiments are increasingly used in studies of protein dynamics on the micro- to millisecond time scale. Traditional R1$\rho$ relaxation dispersion approaches are typically predicated on changes in chemical shifts between corresponding probe spins, $\Delta$$\omega$GE, in the interconverting states. Here, we present a new application of off-resonance 15N R1$\rho$ relaxation dispersion that enables the quantification of slow exchange processes even in the limit where $\Delta$$\omega$GE = 0 so long as the spins in the exchanging states have different intrinsic transverse relaxation rates ($\Delta$R2 = R2,E - R2,G $\neq$ 0). In this limit, the dispersion profiles become inverted relative to those measured in the case where $\Delta$$\omega$GE $\neq$ 0, $\Delta$R2 = 0. The theoretical background to understand this effect is presented, along with a simplified exchange matrix that is valid in the limits that are germane here. An application to the study of the dynamics of the germ granule protein Ddx4 in a highly concentrated phase-separated state is described. Notably, exchange-based dispersion profiles can be obtained despite the fact that $\Delta$$\omega$GE $\approx$ 0 and $\Delta$R2 is small, ∼20-30 s-1. Our results are consistent with the formation of a significantly populated excited conformational state that displays increased contacts between adjacent protein molecules relative to the major conformer in solution, leading to a decrease in overall motion of the protein backbone. A complete set of exchange parameters is obtained from analysis of a single set of 15N off-resonance R1$\rho$ measurements recorded at a single static magnetic field and with a single spin-lock radio frequency field strength. This new approach holds promise for studies of weakly interacting systems, especially those involving intrinsically disordered proteins that form phase-separated organelles, where little change to chemical shifts between interconverting states would be expected, but where finite $\Delta$R2 values are observed.},

The spin glass state found in dilute magnetic alloys has been an exceptionally convenient laboratory frame for studying complex dynamics resulting from a hierarchical energy landscape with rugged funnels. Here, we show, by a bulk susceptibility and Monte Carlo simulation study, that densely populated frustrated magnets in a spin jam state exhibit much weaker memory effects than spin glasses, and the characteristic properties can be reproduced by a nonhierarchical landscape with a wide and nearly flat but rough bottom. Our results illustrate that the memory effects can be used to probe different slow dynamics of glassy materials, hence opening a window to explore their distinct energy landscapes.},

Phthalate dioxygenase reductase (PDR), a soluble iron-sulfur flavoprotein from Pseudomonas cepacia, is a convenient model for the study of this type of electron transfer. PDR is folded into three domains; the NH2-terminal FMN binding and central NAD(H) binding domains are closely related to ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR). The COOH-terminal [2Fe-2S] domain is similar to plant ferredoxins, and can be removed by proteolysis without significantly altering the reactivity of the FNR-like domains. Kinetic studies have identified sequential steps in the reaction of PDR with NADH that involve pyridine nucleotide binding, hydride transfer to FMN, and intramolecular electron transfer from the reduced flavin to the [2Fe-2S] cluster. Crystal structures of reduced and liganded PDR correspond to some of the intermediates formed during reduction by NADH. Small structural changes that are observed in the vicinity of the cofactors upon reduction or NAD(H) binding may provide part of the reorganization energy or contribute to the gating mechanism that controls intramolecular electron transfer.},

abstract = {Under normal cellular conditions, the tumor suppressor protein p53 is kept at low levels in part due to ubiquitination by MDM2, a process initiated by binding of MDM2 to the intrinsically disordered transactivation domain (TAD) of p53. Many experimental and simulation studies suggest that disordered domains such as p53 TAD bind their targets nonspecifically before folding to a tightly associated conformation, but the microscopic details are unclear. Toward a detailed prediction of binding mechanisms, pathways, and rates, we have performed large-scale unbiased all-atom simulations of p53-MDM2 binding. Markov state models (MSMs) constructed from the trajectory data predict p53 TAD binding pathways and on-rates in good agreement with experiment. The MSM reveals that two key bound intermediates, each with a nonnative arrangement of hydrophobic residues in the MDM2 binding cleft, control the overall on-rate. Using microscopic rate information from the MSM, we parameterize a simple four-state kinetic model to 1) determine that induced-fit pathways dominate the binding flux over a large range of concentrations, and 2) predict how modulation of residual p53 helicity affects binding, in good agreement with experiment. These results suggest new ways in which microscopic models of peptide binding, coupled with simple few-state binding flux models, can be used to understand biological function in physiological contexts.},

We find that both systems exhibit shallow free-energy landscapes that link functional states through multiple transition pathways. This observation suggests conformational selection as the general mechanism of allostery in this canonical signalling domain. Further, we expose the propagation of the allosteric signal through key structural motifs in the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain and explore the role of kinetics in its function.

abstract = {Allostery is a phenomenon that couples effector ligand binding at an allosteric site to a structural and/or dynamic change at a distant regulated site. To study an allosteric transition, we vary the size of the allosteric site and its interactions to construct a series of energy landscapes with pronounced minima corresponding to both the effector bound and unbound crystal structures. We use molecular dynamics to sample these landscapes. The degree of perturbation by the effector, modeled by the size of the allosteric site, provides an order parameter for allostery that allows us to determine how microscopic motions give rise to commonly discussed macroscopic mechanisms: (i) induced fit, (ii) population shift, and (iii) entropy driven. These mechanisms involve decreasing structural differences between the effector bound and unbound populations. A metric (ligand-induced cooperativity) can measure how cooperatively a given regulated site responds to effector binding and therefore what kind of allosteric mechanism is involved. We apply the model to three proteins with experimentally characterized transitions: (i) calmodulin-GFP Ca(2+) sensor protein, (ii) maltose binding protein, and (iii) CSL transcription factor. Remarkably, the model is able to reproduce allosteric motion and predict coupling in a manner consistent with experiment.},

A purely mechanical view of allostery invoking only structural changes has developed over the decades as the classical view of the phenomenon. However, a fast growing list of examples illustrate the intimate link between internal motions over a wide range of time scales and function in protein-ligand interactions. Proteins respond to perturbations by redistributing their motions and they use fluctuating conformational states for binding and conformational entropy as a carrier of allosteric energy to modulate association with ligands. In several cases allosteric interactions proceed with minimal or no structural changes. We discuss emerging paradigms for the central role of protein dynamics in allostery.},

abstract = {Heterotrimeric G proteins are signal-transducing switches conserved across eukaryotes. In humans, they work as critical mediators of intercellular communication in the context of virtually any physiological process. While G protein regulation by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is well-established and has received much attention, it has become recently evident that heterotrimeric G proteins can also be activated by cytoplasmic proteins. However, this alternative mechanism of G protein regulation remains far less studied than GPCR-mediated signaling. This Viewpoint focuses on recent advances in the characterization of a group of nonreceptor proteins that contain a sequence dubbed the "G$\alpha$-binding and -activating (GBA) motif". So far, four proteins present in mammals [GIV (also known as Girdin), DAPLE, CALNUC, and NUCB2] and one protein in Caenorhabditis elegans (GBAS-1) have been described as possessing a functional GBA motif. The GBA motif confers guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity on G$\alpha$i subunits in vitro and activates G protein signaling in cells. The importance of this mechanism of signal transduction is highlighted by the fact that its dysregulation underlies human diseases, such as cancer, which has made the proteins attractive new candidates for therapeutic intervention. Here we discuss recent discoveries on the structural basis of GBA-mediated activation of G proteins and its evolutionary conservation and compare them with the better-studied mechanism mediated by GPCRs.},

abstract = {A common challenge to applying metadynamics to the study of complex systems is selecting the proper collective variables to bias. The advent of generic collective variables, specifically social permutation invariant (SPRINT) coordinates, has helped to address this challenge by reducing the level of a priori knowledge required to just basic chemical fundamentals. However, the efficiency of biasing SPRINT coordinates can be severely handicapped by the high dimensionality of the bias potential. Here, we circumvent this deficiency by biasing SPRINT coordinates using the parallel bias metadynamics framework. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method to efficiently explore a complex system, without any prior knowledge about transition pathways, by applying it to study the decomposition of $\gamma$-ketohydroperoxide and generating a comprehensive reaction network of relevant pathways. The reduction in both computational cost and chemical intuition makes this method a promising option for studying complex reacting systems.},

abstract = {For many years, curve-fitting software has been heavily utilized to fit simple models to various types of biophysical data. Although such software packages are easy to use for simple functions, they are often expensive and present substantial impediments to applying more complex models or for the analysis of large data sets. One field that is reliant on such data analysis is the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein folding. Over the past decade, increasingly sophisticated analytical models have been generated, but without simple tools to enable routine analysis. Consequently, users have needed to generate their own tools or otherwise find willing collaborators. Here we present PyFolding, a free, open-source, and extensible Python framework for graphing, analysis, and simulation of the biophysical properties of proteins. To demonstrate the utility of PyFolding, we have used it to analyze and model experimental protein folding and thermodynamic data. Examples include:~1)~multiphase kinetic folding fitted to linked equations, 2) global fitting of multiple data sets, and 3) analysis of repeat protein thermodynamics with Ising model variants. Moreover, we demonstrate how PyFolding is easily extensible to novel functionality beyond applications in protein folding via the addition of new models. Example scripts to perform these and other operations are supplied with the software, and we encourage users to contribute notebooks and models to create a community resource. Finally, we show that PyFolding can be used in conjunction with Jupyter notebooks as an easy way to share methods and analysis for publication and among research teams.},

abstract = {Iron-sulfur clusters are versatile electron transfer cofactors, ubiquitous in metalloenzymes such as hydrogenases. In the oxygen-tolerant Hydrogenase I from Aquifex aeolicus such electron "wires" form a relay to a diheme cytb, an integral part of a respiration pathway for the reduction of O(2) to water. Amino acid sequence comparison with oxygen-sensitive hydrogenases showed conserved binding motifs for three iron-sulfur clusters, the nature and properties of which were unknown so far. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra exhibited complex signals that disclose interesting features and spin-coupling patterns; by redox titrations three iron-sulfur clusters were identified in their usual redox states, a [3Fe4S] and two [4Fe4S], but also a unique high-potential (HP) state was found. On the basis of (57)Fe M{\"o}ssbauer spectroscopy we attribute this HP form to a superoxidized state of the [4Fe4S] center proximal to the [NiFe] site. The unique environment of this cluster, characterized by a surplus cysteine coordination, is able to tune the redox potentials and make it compliant with the [4Fe4S](3+) state. It is actually the first example of a biological [4Fe4S] center that physiologically switches between 3+, 2+, and 1+ oxidation states within a very small potential range. We suggest that the (1~+~/2+) redox couple serves the classical electron transfer reaction, whereas the superoxidation step is associated with a redox switch against oxidative stress.},

abstract = {Allosteric regulation is used as a very efficient mechanism to control protein activity in most biological processes, including signal transduction, metabolism, catalysis and gene regulation. Allosteric proteins can exist in several conformational states with distinct binding or enzymatic activity. Effectors are considered to function in a purely structural manner by selectively stabilizing a specific conformational state, thereby regulating protein activity. Here we show that allosteric proteins can be regulated predominantly by changes in their structural dynamics. We have used NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry to characterize cyclic AMP (cAMP) binding to the catabolite activator protein (CAP), a transcriptional activator that has been a prototype for understanding effector-mediated allosteric control of protein activity. cAMP switches CAP from the 'off' state (inactive), which binds DNA weakly and non-specifically, to the 'on' state (active), which binds DNA strongly and specifically. In contrast, cAMP binding to a single CAP mutant, CAP-S62F, fails to elicit the active conformation; yet, cAMP binding to CAP-S62F strongly activates the protein for DNA binding. NMR and thermodynamic analyses show that despite the fact that CAP-S62F-cAMP(2) adopts the inactive conformation, its strong binding to DNA is driven by a large conformational entropy originating in enhanced protein motions induced by DNA binding. The results provide strong evidence that changes in protein motions may activate allosteric proteins that are otherwise structurally inactive.},

abstract = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are seven transmembrane helix (TM) proteins that transduce signals into living cells by binding extracellular ligands and coupling to intracellular heterotrimeric G proteins (G$\alpha$$\beta$$\gamma$). The photoreceptor rhodopsin couples to transducin and bears its ligand 11-cis-retinal covalently bound via a protonated Schiff base to the opsin apoprotein. Absorption of a photon causes retinal cis/trans isomerization and generates the agonist all-trans-retinal in situ. After early photoproducts, the active G-protein-binding intermediate metarhodopsin II (Meta II) is formed, in which the retinal Schiff base is still intact but deprotonated. Dissociation of the proton from the Schiff base breaks a major constraint in the protein and enables further activating steps, including an outward tilt of TM6 and formation of a large cytoplasmic crevice for uptake of the interacting C terminus of the G$\alpha$ subunit. Owing to Schiff base hydrolysis, Meta II is short-lived and notoriously difficult to crystallize. We therefore soaked opsin crystals with all-trans-retinal to form Meta II, presuming that the crystal's high concentration of opsin in an active conformation (Ops*) may facilitate all-trans-retinal uptake and Schiff base formation. Here we present the 3.0 {\AA} and 2.85 {\AA} crystal structures, respectively, of Meta II alone or in complex with an 11-amino-acid C-terminal fragment derived from G$\alpha$ (G$\alpha$CT2). G$\alpha$CT2 binds in a large crevice at the cytoplasmic side, akin to the binding of a similar G$\alpha$-derived peptide to Ops* (ref. 7). In the Meta II structures, the electron density from the retinal ligand seamlessly continues into the Lys 296 side chain, reflecting proper formation of the Schiff base linkage. The retinal is in a relaxed conformation and almost undistorted compared with pure crystalline all-trans-retinal. By comparison with early photoproducts we propose how retinal translocation and rotation induce the gross conformational changes characteristic for Meta II. The structures can now serve as models for the large GPCR family.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown surprising structural and functional similarities between the motor domains of kinesin and myosin. Common features have also been described for motor proteins and G proteins. Despite these similarities, the evolutionary relationships between these proteins, even among the motor proteins, has not been obvious, since the topological connectivities of the core overlapping structural elements in these transducing proteins are not identical to one another. Using secondary structure topology, comparison of functional domains and active site chemistry as criteria for relatedness, we propose a set of rules for determining potential evolutionary relationships between proteins showing little or no sequence identity. These rules were used to explore the evolutionary relationship between kinesin and myosin, as well as between motor proteins and other phosphate-loop (P-loop) containing nucleotide-binding proteins. We demonstrate that kinesin and myosin show significant chemical conservations within and outside of the active site, and present an evolutionary scheme that produce their respective topologies from a hypothetical ancestral protein. We also show that, when compared with various other P-loop-containing proteins, the cytoskeletal motors are most similar to G proteins with respect to topology and active site chemistry. We conclude that kinesin and myosin, and possibly G proteins, are probably directly related via divergent evolution from a common core nucleotide-binding motif, and describe the likely topology of this ancestor. These proteins use similar chemical and physical mechanisms to both sense the state of the nucleotide bound in the active site, and then transmit these changes to protein partners. The different topologies can be accounted for by unique genetic insertions that add to the edge of a progenitor protein structure and do not disrupt the hydrophobic core.},

Using 13C methyl methionine NMR for the $\beta$1-adrenergic receptor, we identify ligand efficacy-dependent equilibria between an inactive and pre-active state and, in complex with Gs-mimetic nanobody, between more and less active ternary complexes. Formation of a basal activity complex through ligand-free nanobody-receptor interaction reveals structural differences on the cytoplasmic receptor side compared to the full agonist-bound nanobody-coupled form, suggesting that ligand-induced variations in G-protein interaction underpin partial agonism. Significant differences in receptor dynamics are observed ranging from rigid nanobody-coupled states to extensive $\mu$s-to-ms timescale dynamics when bound to a full agonist. We suggest that the mobility of the full agonist-bound form primes the GPCR to couple to IBPs.

abstract = {Agonist-bound heptahelical receptors activate heterotrimeric G proteins by catalyzing exchange of GDP for GTP on their alpha subunits. In search of an approximation of the receptor-alpha subunit complex, we have considered the properties of A326S Gialpha1, a mutation discovered originally in Gsalpha (Iiri, T., Herzmark, P., Nakamoto, J. M., Van Dop, C., and Bourne, H. R. (1994) Nature 371, 164-168) that mimics the effect of receptor on nucleotide exchange. The mutation accelerates dissociation of GDP from the alphai1beta1gamma2 heterotrimer by 250-fold. Nevertheless, affinity of mutant Gialpha1 for GTPgammaS is high in the presence of Mg2+, and the mutation has no effect on the intrinsic GTPase activity of the alpha subunit. The mutation also uncouples two activities of betagamma: stabilization of the GDP-bound alpha subunit (which is retained) and retardation of GDP dissociation from the heterotrimer (which is lost). For wild-type and mutant Gialpha1, beta gamma prevents irreversible inactivation of the alpha subunit at 30 degreesC. However, the mutation accelerates irreversible inactivation of alpha at 37 degreesC despite the presence of beta gamma. Structurally, the mutation weakens affinity for GTPgammaS by steric crowding: a 2-fold increase in the number of close contacts between the protein and the purine ring of the nucleotide. By contrast, we observe no differences in structure at the GDP binding site between wild-type heterotrimers and those containing A326S Gialpha1. However, the GDP binding site is only partially occupied in crystals of G protein heterotrimers containing A326S Gialpha1. In contrast to original speculations about the structural correlates of receptor-catalyzed nucleotide exchange, rapid dissociation of GDP can be observed in the absence of substantial structural alteration of a Galpha subunit in the GDP-bound state.},

abstract = {We introduce an approach for computing the free energy and the probability density in high-dimensional spaces, such as those explored in molecular dynamics simulations of biomolecules. The approach exploits the presence of correlations between the coordinates, induced, in molecular dynamics, by the chemical nature of the molecules. Due to these correlations, the data points lay on a manifold that can be highly curved and twisted, but whose dimension is normally small. We estimate the free energies by finding, with a statistical test, the largest neighborhood in which the free energy in the embedding manifold can be considered constant. Importantly, this procedure does not require defining explicitly the manifold and provides an estimate of the error that is approximately unbiased up to large dimensions. We test this approach on artificial and real data sets, demonstrating that the free energy estimates are reliable for data sets on manifolds of dimension up to ∼10, embedded in an arbitrarily large space. In practical applications our method permits the estimation of the free energy in a space of reduced dimensionality without specifying the collective variables defining this space.},

abstract = {Thymidylate is a DNA nucleotide that is essential to all organisms and is synthesized by the enzyme thymidylate synthase (TSase). Several human pathogens rely on an alternative flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase (FDTS), which differs from the human TSase both in structure and molecular mechanism. It has recently been shown that FDTS catalysis does not rely on an enzymatic nucleophile and that the proposed reaction intermediates are not covalently bound to the enzyme during catalysis, an important distinction from the human TSase. Here we report the chemical trapping, isolation, and identification of a derivative of such an intermediate in the FDTS-catalyzed reaction. The chemically modified reaction intermediate is consistent with currently proposed FDTS mechanisms that do not involve an enzymatic nucleophile, and it has never been observed during any other TSase reaction. These findings establish the timing of the methylene transfer during FDTS catalysis. The presented methodology provides an important experimental tool for further studies of FDTS, which may assist efforts directed toward the rational design of inhibitors as leads for future antibiotics.},

abstract = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are membrane proteins that allosterically transduce the signal of ligand binding in the extracellular (EC) domain to couple to proteins in the intracellular (IC) domain. However, the complete pathway of allosteric communication from the EC to the IC domain, including the role of individual amino acids in the pathway is not known. Using the correlation in torsion angle movements calculated from microseconds-long molecular-dynamics simulations, we elucidated the allosteric pathways in three different conformational states of $\beta$2-adrenergic receptor ($\beta$2AR): 1), the inverse-agonist-bound inactive state; 2), the agonist-bound intermediate state; and (3), the agonist- and G-protein-bound fully active state. The inactive state is less dynamic compared with the intermediate and active states, showing dense clusters of allosteric pathways (allosteric pipelines) connecting the EC with the IC domain. The allosteric pipelines from the EC domain to the IC domain are weakened in the intermediate state, thus decoupling the EC domain from the IC domain and making the receptor more dynamic compared with the other states. Also, the orthosteric ligand-binding site becomes the initiator region for allosteric communication in the intermediate state. This finding agrees with the paradigm that the nature of the agonist governs the specific signaling state of the receptor. These results provide an understanding of the mechanism of allosteric communication in class A GPCRs. In addition, our analysis shows that mutations that affect the ligand efficacy, but not the binding affinity, are located in the allosteric pipelines. This clarifies the role of such mutations, which has hitherto been unexplained.},

ApoE4 is the major risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, whereas apoE3, the common isoform, is neutral with respect to this disease. Here, using literature data from both hydrogen-deuterium exchange and site-directed mutations, we suggest structural differences between these two isoforms that are distant from the site of the arginine-to-cysteine change. These structural differences involve sequences from both the N- and C-terminal domains, sequentially far apart but structurally close. In addition, these regions are close to regions that bind lipid and to a region involved in association of apoE monomers to higher molecular weight forms. We discuss the possibility that these regions could be targeted preferentially to affect the function of apoE4 relative to apoE3.},

Based on previously determined rate constants for a complex Markovian model describing the gating of homotetrameric HCN2 channels, we analyzed probability fluxes within this model, including unidirectional probability fluxes and the probability flux along transition paths. The time-dependent probability fluxes quantify the contributions of all 13 transitions of the model to channel activation. The binding of the first, third and fourth ligand evoked robust channel opening whereas the binding of the second ligand obstructed channel opening similar to the empty channel. Analysis of the net probability fluxes in terms of the transition path theory revealed pronounced hysteresis for channel activation and deactivation. These results provide quantitative insight into the complex interaction of the four structurally equal subunits, leading to non-equality in their function.},

abstract = {Markov state models (MSMs) and other related kinetic network models are frequently used to study the long-timescale dynamical behavior of biomolecular and materials systems. MSMs are often constructed bottom-up using brute-force molecular dynamics (MD) simulations when the model contains a large number of states and kinetic pathways that are not known a priori. However, the resulting network generally encompasses only parts of the configurational space, and regardless of any additional MD performed, several states and pathways will still remain missing. This implies that the duration for which the MSM can faithfully capture the true dynamics, which we term as the validity time for the MSM, is always finite and unfortunately much shorter than the MD time invested to construct the model. A general framework that relates the kinetic uncertainty in the model to the validity time, missing states and pathways, network topology, and statistical sampling is presented. Performing additional calculations for frequently-sampled states/pathways may not alter the MSM validity time. A new class of enhanced kinetic sampling techniques is introduced that aims at targeting rare states/pathways that contribute most to the uncertainty so that the validity time is boosted in an effective manner. Examples including straightforward 1D energy landscapes, lattice models, and biomolecular systems are provided to illustrate the application of the method. Developments presented here will be of interest to the kinetic Monte Carlo community as well.},

abstract = {Classical Hamiltonian trajectories are initiated at random points in phase space on a fixed energy shell of a model two degrees of freedom potential, consisting of two interacting minima in an otherwise flat energy plane of infinite extent. Below the energy of the plane, the dynamics are demonstrably chaotic. However, most of the work in this paper involves trajectories at a fixed energy that is 1% above that of the plane, in which regime the dynamics exhibit behavior characteristic of chaotic scattering. The trajectories are analyzed without reference to the potential, as if they had been generated in a typical direct molecular dynamics simulation. The questions addressed are whether one can recover useful information about the structures controlling the dynamics in phase space from the trajectory data alone, and whether, despite the at least partially chaotic nature of the dynamics, one can make statistically meaningful predictions of trajectory outcomes from initial conditions. It is found that key unstable periodic orbits, which can be identified on the analytical potential, appear by simple classification of the trajectories, and that the specific roles of these periodic orbits in controlling the dynamics are also readily discerned from the trajectory data alone. Two different approaches to predicting trajectory outcomes from initial conditions are evaluated, and it is shown that the more successful of them has ∼90% success. The results are compared with those from a simple neural network, which has higher predictive success (97%) but requires the information obtained from the "by-hand" analysis to achieve that level. Finally, the dynamics, which occur partly on the very flat region of the potential, show characteristics of the much-studied phenomenon called "roaming." On this potential, it is found that roaming trajectories are effectively "failed" periodic orbits and that angular momentum can be identified as a key controlling factor, despite the fact that it is not a strictly conserved quantity. It is also noteworthy that roaming on this potential occurs in the absence of a "roaming saddle," which has previously been hypothesized to be a necessary feature for roaming to occur.},

We show that the protein within the concentrated phase of phase-separated Ddx4, [Formula: see text], diffuses as a particle of 600-nm hydrodynamic radius dissolved in water. However, NMR spectra reveal sharp resonances with chemical shifts showing [Formula: see text] to be intrinsically disordered. Spin relaxation measurements indicate that the backbone amides of [Formula: see text] have significant mobility, explaining why high-resolution spectra are observed, but motion is reduced compared with an equivalently concentrated nonphase-separating control. Observation of a network of interchain interactions, as established by NOE spectroscopy, shows the importance of Phe and Arg interactions in driving the phase separation of Ddx4, while the salt dependence of both low- and high-concentration regions of phase diagrams establishes an important role for electrostatic interactions. The diffusion of a series of small probes and the compact but disordered 4E binding protein 2 (4E-BP2) protein in [Formula: see text] are explained by an excluded volume effect, similar to that found for globular protein solvents. No changes in structural propensities of 4E-BP2 dissolved in [Formula: see text] are observed, while changes to DNA and RNA molecules have been reported, highlighting the diverse roles that proteinaceous solvents play in dictating the properties of dissolved solutes.},

abstract = {Allostery enables tight regulation of protein function in the cellular environment. Although existing models of allostery are firmly rooted in the current structure-function paradigm, the mechanistic basis for allostery in the absence of structural change remains unclear. In this study, we show that a typical globular protein is able to undergo significant changes in volume under native conditions while exhibiting no additional changes in protein structure. These native state volume fluctuations were found to correlate with changes in internal motions that were previously recognized as a source of allosteric entropy. This finding offers a novel mechanistic basis for allostery in the absence of canonical structural change. The unexpected observation that function can be derived from expanded, low density protein states has broad implications for our understanding of allostery and suggests that the general concept of the native state be expanded to allow for more variable physical dimensions with looser packing.},

abstract = {In 1928, Dirac published an equation1that combined quantum mechanics and special relativity. Negative-energy solutions to this equation, rather than being unphysical as initially thought, represented a class of hitherto unobserved and unimagined particles-antimatter. The existence of particles of antimatter was confirmed with the discovery of the positron2(or anti-electron) by Anderson in 1932, but it is still unknown why matter, rather than antimatter, survived after the Big Bang. As a result, experimental studies of antimatter3-7, including tests of fundamental symmetries such as charge-parity and charge-parity-time, and searches for evidence of primordial antimatter, such as antihelium nuclei, have high priority in contemporary physics research. The fundamental role of the hydrogen atom in the evolution of the Universe and in the historical development of our understanding of quantum physics makes its antimatter counterpart-the antihydrogen atom-of particular interest. Current standard-model physics requires that hydrogen and antihydrogen have the same energy levels and spectral lines. The laser-driven 1S-2S transition was recently observed8in antihydrogen. Here we characterize one of the hyperfine components of this transition using magnetically trapped atoms of antihydrogen and compare it to model calculations for hydrogen in our apparatus. We find that the shape of the spectral line agrees very well with that expected for hydrogen and that the resonance frequency agrees with that in hydrogen to about 5 kilohertz out of 2.5 {\texttimes} 1015hertz. This is consistent with charge-parity-time invariance at a relative precision of 2 {\texttimes} 10-12-two orders of magnitude more precise than the previous determination8-corresponding to an absolute energy sensitivity of 2 {\texttimes} 10-20GeV.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown surprising structural and functional similarities between the motor domains of kinesin and myosin. Common features have also been described for motor proteins and G proteins. Despite these similarities, the evolutionary relationships between these proteins, even among the motor proteins, has not been obvious, since the topological connectivities of the core overlapping structural elements in these transducing proteins are not identical to one another. Using secondary structure topology, comparison of functional domains and active site chemistry as criteria for relatedness, we propose a set of rules for determining potential evolutionary relationships between proteins showing little or no sequence identity. These rules were used to explore the evolutionary relationship between kinesin and myosin, as well as between motor proteins and other phosphate-loop (P-loop) containing nucleotide-binding proteins. We demonstrate that kinesin and myosin show significant chemical conservations within and outside of the active site, and present an evolutionary scheme that produce their respective topologies from a hypothetical ancestral protein. We also show that, when compared with various other P-loop-containing proteins, the cytoskeletal motors are most similar to G proteins with respect to topology and active site chemistry. We conclude that kinesin and myosin, and possibly G proteins, are probably directly related via divergent evolution from a common core nucleotide-binding motif, and describe the likely topology of this ancestor. These proteins use similar chemical and physical mechanisms to both sense the state of the nucleotide bound in the active site, and then transmit these changes to protein partners. The different topologies can be accounted for by unique genetic insertions that add to the edge of a progenitor protein structure and do not disrupt the hydrophobic core.},

In 2014, after a young man murdered six students at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and then killed himself, the news provoked an eye-opening surge of feminist activism. Fueled by the wide circulation of the killer{\textquoteright}s hateful manifesto and his desire to exact {\textquotedblleft}revenge{\textquotedblright} upon young women, feminists online and offline around the world clamored for a halt to such acts of misogyny. Despite the widespread belief that feminism is out-of-style or dead, this mobilization of young women fighting against gender oppression was overwhelming. In Finding Feminism, Alison Dahl Crossley analyzes feminist activists at three different U.S. colleges, revealing that feminism is alive on campuses, but is complex, nuanced, and context-dependent. Young feminists are carrying the torch of the movement, despite a climate that is not always receptive to their claims. These feminists are engaged in social justice organizing in unexpected contexts and spaces, such as multicultural sororities, student government, and online. Sharing personal stories of their everyday experiences with inequality, the young women in Finding Feminism employ both traditional and innovative feminist tactics. They use the Internet and social media as a tool for their activism{\textemdash}what Alison Dahl Crossley calls {\textquoteleft}Facebook Feminism.{\textquoteright} The university, as an institution, simultaneously aids and constrains their fight for gender equality.

abstract = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) serve as catalytic activators of heterotrimeric G-proteins (Galphabetagamma) by exchanging GTP for the bound GDP on the Galpha subunit. This guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity of GPCRs is the initial step in the G-protein cycle and determines the onset of various intracellular signaling pathways that govern critical physiological responses to extracellular cues. Although the structural basis for many steps in the G-protein nucleotide cycle have been made clear over the past decade, the precise mechanism for receptor-mediated G-protein activation remains incompletely defined. Given that these receptors have historically represented a set of rich drug targets, a more complete understanding of their mechanism of action should provide further avenues for drug discovery. Several models have been proposed to explain the communication between activated GPCRs and Galphabetagamma leading to the structural changes required for guanine nucleotide exchange. This review is focused on the structural biology of G-protein signal transduction with an emphasis on the current hypotheses regarding Galphabetagamma activation. We highlight several recent results shedding new light on the structural changes in Galpha that may underlie GDP release.},

    abstract = {Allostery is an inherent feature of proteins, but it remains challenging to reveal the mechanisms by which allosteric signals propagate. A clearer understanding of this intrinsic circuitry would afford new opportunities to modulate protein function. Here, we have identified allosteric sites in protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) by combining multiple-temperature X-ray crystallography experiments and structure determination from hundreds of individual small-molecule fragment soaks. New modeling approaches reveal 'hidden' low-occupancy conformational states for protein and ligands. Our results converge on allosteric sites that are conformationally coupled to the active-site WPD loop and are hotspots for fragment binding. Targeting one of these sites with covalently tethered molecules or mutations allosterically inhibits enzyme activity. Overall, this work demonstrates how the ensemble nature of macromolecular structure, revealed here by multitemperature crystallography, can elucidate allosteric mechanisms and open new doors for long-range control of protein function.
          , 
            Proteins perform many important jobs in each of the cells in our bodies, such as transporting other molecules and helping chemical reactions to occur. The part of the protein directly involved in these tasks is called the active site. Other areas of the protein can communicate with the active site to switch the protein on or off. This method of control is known as allostery.
            Switching proteins on and off could help us to develop treatments for certain diseases. For example, a protein called PTP1B reduces how well cells can respond to insulin. Switching this protein off could therefore help to treat diabetes. However, much like it’s hard to guess how a light switch is wired to a light bulb without seeing behind the walls, it is hard to predict which remote areas of a protein are ‘wired’ to the active site.
            Keedy, Hill et al. have now used two complementary methods to examine the structure of PTP1B and find new allosteric sites. The first method captured a series of X-ray images from crystallized molecules of the protein held at different temperatures. This revealed areas of PTP1B that can move like windshield wipers to communicate with each other. The second method soaked PTP1B crystals in trays with hundreds of drug-sized molecules and assessed which sites on the protein the molecules bound to. The molecules generally bound to just a few sites of the protein. Further tests on one of these sites showed that it can communicate with the active site to turn the protein on or off.
            Further work will be needed to develop drugs that could treat diabetes by binding to the newly identified allosteric sites in PTP1B. More generally, the methods developed by Keedy, Hill et al. could be used to study allostery in other important proteins.},

    abstract = {ABSTRACT
            The Ebola virus VP35 protein was previously found to act as an interferon (IFN) antagonist which could complement growth of influenza delNS1 virus, a mutant influenza virus lacking the influenza virus IFN antagonist protein, NS1. The Ebola virus VP35 could also prevent the virus- or double-stranded RNA-mediated transcriptional activation of both the beta IFN (IFN-β) promoter and the IFN-stimulated ISG54 promoter (C. Basler et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:12289-12294, 2000). We now show that VP35 inhibits virus infection-induced transcriptional activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3)-responsive mammalian promoters and that VP35 does not block signaling from the IFN-α/β receptor. The ability of VP35 to inhibit this virus-induced transcription correlates with its ability to block activation of IRF-3, a cellular transcription factor of central importance in initiating the host cell IFN response. We demonstrate that VP35 blocks the Sendai virus-induced activation of two promoters which can be directly activated by IRF-3, namely, the ISG54 promoter and the ISG56 promoter. Further, expression of VP35 prevents the IRF-3-dependent activation of the IFN-α4 promoter in response to viral infection. The inhibition of IRF-3 appears to occur through an inhibition of IRF-3 phosphorylation. VP35 blocks virus-induced IRF-3 phosphorylation and subsequent IRF-3 dimerization and nuclear translocation. Consistent with these observations, Ebola virus infection of Vero cells activated neither transcription from the ISG54 promoter nor nuclear accumulation of IRF-3. These data suggest that in Ebola virus-infected cells, VP35 inhibits the induction of antiviral genes, including the IFN-β gene, by blocking IRF-3 activation.},

            The Ebola virus (EBOV) VP35 protein blocks the virus-induced phosphorylation and activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), a transcription factor critical for the induction of alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β) expression. However, the mechanism(s) by which this blockage occurs remains incompletely defined. We now provide evidence that VP35 possesses double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding activity. Specifically, VP35 bound to poly(rI) · poly(rC)-coated Sepharose beads but not control beads. In contrast, two VP35 point mutants, R312A and K309A, were found to be greatly impaired in their dsRNA-binding activity. Competition assays showed that VP35 interacted specifically with poly(rI) · poly(rC), poly(rA) · poly(rU), or in vitro-transcribed dsRNAs derived from EBOV sequences, and not with single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs) or double-stranded DNA. We then screened wild-type and mutant VP35s for their ability to target different components of the signaling pathways that activate IRF-3. These experiments indicate that VP35 blocks activation of IRF-3 induced by overexpression of RIG-I, a cellular helicase recently implicated in the activation of IRF-3 by either virus or dsRNA. Interestingly, the VP35 mutants impaired for dsRNA binding have a decreased but measurable IFN antagonist activity in these assays. Additionally, wild-type and dsRNA-binding-mutant VP35s were found to have equivalent abilities to inhibit activation of the IFN-β promoter induced by overexpression of IPS-1, a recently identified signaling molecule downstream of RIG-I, or by overexpression of the IRF-3 kinases IKKε and TBK-1. These data support the hypothesis that dsRNA binding may contribute to VP35 IFN antagonist function. However, additional mechanisms of inhibition, at a point proximal to the IRF-3 kinases, most likely also exist.},

            The VP35 protein of Zaire Ebola virus is an essential component of the viral RNA polymerase complex and also functions to antagonize the cellular type I interferon (IFN) response by blocking activation of the transcription factor IRF-3. We previously mapped the IRF-3 inhibitory domain within the C terminus of VP35. In the present study, we show that mutations that disrupt the IRF-3 inhibitory function of VP35 do not disrupt viral transcription/replication, suggesting that the two functions of VP35 are separable. Second, using reverse genetics, we successfully recovered recombinant Ebola viruses containing mutations within the IRF-3 inhibitory domain. Importantly, we show that the recombinant viruses were attenuated for growth in cell culture and that they activated IRF-3 and IRF-3-inducible gene expression at levels higher than that for Ebola virus containing wild-type VP35. In the context of Ebola virus pathogenesis, VP35 may function to limit early IFN-β production and other antiviral signals generated from cells at the primary site of infection, thereby slowing down the host's ability to curb virus replication and induce adaptive immunity.},

              Ebola virus (EBOV) protein VP35 is a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding inhibitor of host interferon (IFN)-α/β responses that also functions as a viral polymerase cofactor. Recent structural studies identified key features, including a central basic patch, required for VP35 dsRNA binding activity. To address the functional significance of these VP35 structural features for EBOV replication and pathogenesis, two point mutations, K319A/R322A, that abrogate VP35 dsRNA binding activity and severely impair its suppression of IFN-α/β production were identified. Solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography reveal minimal structural perturbations in the K319A/R322A VP35 double mutant and suggest that loss of basic charge leads to altered function. Recombinant EBOVs encoding the mutant VP35 exhibit, relative to wild-type VP35 viruses, minimal growth attenuation in IFN-defective Vero cells but severe impairment in IFN-competent cells. In guinea pigs, the VP35 mutant virus revealed a complete loss of virulence. Strikingly, the VP35 mutant virus effectively immunized animals against subsequent wild-type EBOV challenge. These
              in vivo
              studies, using recombinant EBOV viruses, combined with the accompanying biochemical and structural analyses directly correlate VP35 dsRNA binding and IFN inhibition functions with viral pathogenesis. Moreover, these studies provide a framework for the development of antivirals targeting this critical EBOV virulence factor.},

    abstract = {ABSTRACT
            The ebolavirus (EBOV) VP35 protein binds to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), inhibits host alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β) production, and is an essential component of the viral polymerase complex. Structural studies of the VP35 C-terminal IFN inhibitory domain (IID) identified specific structural features, including a central basic patch and a hydrophobic pocket, that are important for dsRNA binding and IFN inhibition. Several other conserved basic residues bordering the central basic patch and a separate cluster of basic residues, called the first basic patch, were also identified. Functional analysis of alanine substitution mutants indicates that basic residues outside the central basic patch are not required for dsRNA binding or for IFN inhibition. However, minigenome assays, which assess viral RNA polymerase complex function, identified these other basic residues to be critical for viral RNA synthesis. Of these, a subset located within the first basic patch is important for VP35-nucleoprotein (NP) interaction, as evidenced by the inability of alanine substitution mutants to coimmunoprecipitate with NP. Therefore, first basic patch residues are likely critical for replication complex formation through interactions with NP. Coimmunoprecipitation studies further demonstrate that the VP35 IID is sufficient to interact with NP and that dsRNA can modulate VP35 IID interactions with NP. Other basic residue mutations that disrupt the VP35 polymerase cofactor function do not affect interaction with NP or with the amino terminus of the viral polymerase. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of conserved basic residues from the EBOV VP35 C-terminal IID and validate the VP35 IID as a potential therapeutic target.},

    abstract = {Background While the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 is spreading worldwide, there is much concern over the mortality rate that the infection induces. Available data suggest that COVID-19 case fatality rate varies temporally (as the epidemic progresses) and spatially (among countries). Here, we attempted to identify key factors possibly explaining the variability in case fatality rate across countries.
Methods We used data on the temporal trajectory of case fatality rate provided by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, and country-specific data on different metrics describing the incidence of known comorbidity factors associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality at the individual level (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation). We also compiled data on demography, economy and political regimes for each country.
Findings We first showed that temporal trajectories of case fatality rate greatly vary among countries. We found no evidence for association between comorbidities and case fatality rate at the country level. Case fatality rate was negatively associated with number of hospital beds x1,000 inhabitants. We also report evidence suggesting an association between case fatality rate and the political regime, with democracies suffering from the highest mortality burden, compared to autocratic regimes. However, most of the among-country variance in case fatality rate remained unexplained. 
Interpretation Overall, these results emphasize the role of socio-economic and political factors as possible drivers of COVID-19 case fatality rate at the country level.

    abstract = {Elucidating the conformational heterogeneity of proteins is essential for understanding protein function and developing exogenous ligands. With the rapid development of experimental and computational methods, it is of great interest to integrate these approaches to illuminate the conformational landscapes of target proteins. SETD8 is a protein lysine methyltransferase (PKMT), which functions in vivo via the methylation of histone and nonhistone targets. Utilizing covalent inhibitors and depleting native ligands to trap hidden conformational states, we obtained diverse X-ray structures of SETD8. These structures were used to seed distributed atomistic molecular dynamics simulations that generated a total of six milliseconds of trajectory data. Markov state models, built via an automated machine learning approach and corroborated experimentally, reveal how slow conformational motions and conformational states are relevant to catalysis. These findings provide molecular insight on enzymatic catalysis and allosteric mechanisms of a PKMT via its detailed conformational landscape.
          , 
            Our cells contain thousands of proteins that perform many different tasks. Such tasks often involve significant changes in the shape of a protein that allow it to interact with other proteins or ligands. Understanding these shape changes can be an essential step for predicting and manipulating how proteins work or designing new drugs. Some changes in protein shape happen quickly, whereas others take longer. Existing experimental approaches generally only capture some, but not all, of the different shapes an individual protein adopts.
            A family of proteins known as protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs) help to regulate the activities of other proteins by adding small tags called methyl groups to specific positions on their target proteins. PKMTs play important roles in many life processes including in activating genes, maintaining stem cells and controlling how organs develop.
            It is important for cells to properly control the activity of PKMTs because too much, or too little, activity can promote cancers and neurological diseases. For example, genetic mutations that increase the levels of a PKMT known as SETD8 appear to promote the progression of some breast cancers and childhood leukemia. There is a pressing need to develop new drugs that can inhibit SETD8 and other PKMTs in human patients. However, these efforts are hindered by the lack of understanding of exactly how the shape of PKMT proteins change as they operate in cells.
            Chen, Wiewiora et al. used a technique called X-ray crystallography to generate structural models of the human SETD8 protein in the presence or absence of native or foreign ligands. These models were used to develop computer simulations of how the shape of SETD8 changes as it operates. Further computational analysis and laboratory experiments revealed how slow changes in the shape of SETD8 contribute to the ability of the protein to attach methyl groups to other proteins.
            This work is a significant stepping-stone to developing a complete model of how the SETD8 protein works, as well as understanding how genetic mutations may affect the protein’s role in the body. The next step is to refine the model by integrating data from other approaches including biophysical models and mathematical calculations of the energy associated with the shape changes, with a long-term goal to better understand and then manipulate the function of SETD8.},

    abstract = {Myosin motor domains perform an extraordinary diversity of biological functions despite sharing a common mechanochemical cycle. Motors are adapted to their function, in part, by tuning the thermodynamics and kinetics of steps in this cycle. However, it remains unclear how sequence encodes these differences, since biochemically distinct motors often have nearly indistinguishable crystal structures. We hypothesized that sequences produce distinct biochemical phenotypes by modulating the relative probabilities of an ensemble of conformations primed for different functional roles. To test this hypothesis, we modeled the distribution of conformations for 12 myosin motor domains by building Markov state models (MSMs) from an unprecedented two milliseconds of all-atom, explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations. Comparing motors reveals shifts in the balance between nucleotide-favorable and nucleotide-unfavorable P-loop conformations that predict experimentally measured duty ratios and ADP release rates better than sequence or individual structures. This result demonstrates the power of an ensemble perspective for interrogating sequence-function relationships.},

The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To facilitate medical countermeasure development, we determined a 3.5-angstrom-resolution cryo–electron microscopy structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation. We also provide biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S protein binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with higher affinity than does severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV S. Additionally, we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to 2019-nCoV S, suggesting that antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two RBDs. The structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable the rapid development and evaluation of medical countermeasures to address the ongoing public health crisis.},

    abstract = {Abstract
          The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein is an abundant RNA binding protein that plays a variety of roles in the viral life cycle including replication, transcription, and genome packaging. Despite its critical and multifunctional nature, the molecular details that underlie how N protein mediates these functions are poorly understood. Here we combine single-molecule spectroscopy with all-atom simulations to uncover the molecular details that contribute to the function of SARS-CoV-2 N protein. N protein contains three intrinsically disordered regions and two folded domains. All three disordered regions are highly dynamic and contain regions of transient helicity that appear to act as local binding interfaces for protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions. The two folded domains do not significantly interact with one another, such that full-length N protein is a flexible and multivalent RNA binding protein. As observed for other proteins with similar molecular features, we found that N protein undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation when mixed with RNA. Polymer models predict that the same multivalent interactions that drive phase separation also engender RNA compaction. We propose a simple model in which symmetry breaking through specific binding sites promotes the formation of metastable single-RNA condensate, as opposed to large multi-RNA phase separated droplets. We speculate that RNA compaction to form dynamic single-genome condensates may underlie the early stages of genome packaging. As such, assays that measure how compounds modulate phase separation could provide a convenient tool for identifying drugs that disrupt viral packaging.},

    abstract = {Abstract
          Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which is currently negatively affecting the population and disrupting the global economy. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the +RNA virus family that utilize single-stranded positive-sense RNA molecules as genomes. SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, has an unusually large genome for a +RNA virus that encodes four structural proteins – the matrix (M), small envelope (E), spike (S) and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) - and sixteen nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16) that together ensure replication of the virus in the host cell. The nucleocapsid phosphoprotein N is essential for linking the viral genome to the viral membrane. Its N-terminal RNA binding domain (N-NTD) captures the RNA genome while the C-terminal domain anchors the ribonucleoprotein complex to the viral membrane via its interaction with the M protein. Here, we characterized the structure of the N-NTD and its interaction with RNA using NMR spectroscopy. We observed a positively charged canyon on the surface of the N-NTD lined with arginine residues suggesting a putative RNA binding site. Next, we performed an NMR titration experiment using an RNA duplex. The observed changes in positions of signals in the N-NTD NMR spectra allowed us to construct a model of the N-NTD in complex with RNA.},

The gloomier view is that protein structure and enzyme function are the finely balanced end-products of many weak interactions that can be summed only by massive computing power, and more precise parameterization than we enjoy at present. The cheerier position is that proteins are built on definable principles, and that enzymes use recognizable catalytic devices that will allow us to understand how existing enzymes work and to design new ones. To assess which interpretation is the more realistic, the simple reaction catalysed by triosephosphate isomerase is considered here. This examination illustrates some of the catalytic features of enzymes that are understood, and exposes a few that are not. But overall, the question turns out to have an optimistic answer.},

    abstract = {CTX-M β-lactamases are widespread in Gram-negative bacterial pathogens and provide resistance to the cephalosporin cefotaxime but not to the related antibiotic ceftazidime. Nevertheless, variants have emerged that confer resistance to ceftazidime. Two natural mutations, causing P167S and D240G substitutions in the CTX-M enzyme, result in 10-fold increased hydrolysis of ceftazidime. Although the combination of these mutations would be predicted to increase ceftazidime hydrolysis further, the P167S/D240G combination has not been observed in a naturally occurring CTX-M variant. Here, using recombinantly expressed enzymes, minimum inhibitory concentration measurements, steady-state enzyme kinetics, and X-ray crystallography, we show that the P167S/D240G double mutant enzyme exhibits decreased ceftazidime hydrolysis, lower thermostability, and decreased protein expression levels compared with each of the single mutants, indicating negative epistasis. X-ray structures of mutant enzymes with covalently trapped ceftazidime suggested that a change of an active-site Ω-loop to an open conformation accommodates ceftazidime leading to enhanced catalysis. 10-μs molecular dynamics simulations further correlated Ω-loop opening with catalytic activity. We observed that the WT and P167S/D240G variant with acylated ceftazidime both favor a closed conformation not conducive for catalysis. In contrast, the single substitutions dramatically increased the probability of open conformations. We conclude that the antagonism is due to restricting the conformation of the Ω-loop. These results reveal the importance of conformational heterogeneity of active-site loops in controlling catalytic activity and directing evolutionary trajectories.},

Specifically, evolutionary trajectories leading to functional optimization for a given host environment or to the emergence of a new function typically involve enriching catalytically competent conformations and/or the freezing out of non-competent conformations of an enzyme. In some cases, these evolutionary changes are achieved through distant mutations that shift the protein ensemble towards productive conformations. Multifunctional intermediates in evolutionary trajectories are probably multi-conformational, i.e. able to switch between different overall conformations, each competent for a given function. Conformational diversity can assist the emergence of a completely new active site through a single mutation by facilitating transition-state binding. We propose that this mechanism may have played a role in the emergence of enzymes at the primordial, progenote stage, where it was plausibly promoted by high environmental temperatures and the possibility of additional phenotypic mutations.},

              The widespread use of oxyimino-cephalosporin antibiotics drives the evolution of the CTX-M family of β-lactamases that hydrolyze these drugs and confer antibiotic resistance. Clinically isolated CTX-M enzymes carrying the P167S or D240G active site-associated adaptive mutation have a broadened substrate profile that includes the oxyimino-cephalosporin antibiotic ceftazidime. The D240G substitution is known to reduce the stability of CTX-M-14 β-lactamase, and the P167S substitution is shown here to also destabilize the enzyme. Proteins are marginally stable entities, and second-site mutations that stabilize the enzyme can offset a loss in stability caused by mutations that enhance enzyme activity. Therefore, the evolution of antibiotic resistance enzymes can be dependent on the acquisition of stabilizing mutations. The A77V substitution is present in CTX-M extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) from a number of clinical isolates, suggesting that it may be important in the evolution of antibiotic resistance in this family of β-lactamases. In this study, the effects of the A77V substitution in the CTX-M-14 model enzyme were characterized with regard to the kinetic parameters for antibiotic hydrolysis as well as enzyme expression levels
              in vivo
              and protein stability
              in vitro
              . The A77V substitution has little effect on the kinetics of oxyimino-cephalosporin hydrolysis, but it stabilizes the CTX-M enzyme and compensates for the loss of stability resulting from the P167S and D240G mutations. The acquisition of global stabilizing mutations, such as A77V, is an important feature in β-lactamase evolution and a common mechanism in protein evolution.},

              CTX-M-19 is a recently identified ceftazidime-hydrolyzing extended-spectrum β-lactamase, which differs from the majority of CTX-M-type β-lactamases that preferentially hydrolyze cefotaxime but not ceftazidime. To elucidate the mechanism of ceftazidime hydrolysis by CTX-M-19, the β-lactam MICs of a CTX-M-19 producer, and the kinetic parameters of the enzyme were confirmed. We reconfirmed here that CTX-M-19 is also stable at a high enzyme concentration in the presence of bovine serum albumin (20 μg/ml). Under this condition, we obtained more accurate kinetic parameters and determined that cefotaxime (

Using the previously reported crystal structure of the Toho-1 β-lactamase, which belongs to the CTX-M-type β-lactamase group, we have suggested characteristic interactions between the enzymes and the β-lactams ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and aztreonam by molecular modeling. Aminothiazole-bearing β-lactams require a displacement of the aminothiazole moiety due to a severe steric interaction with the hydroxyl group of Ser167 in CTX-M-19, and the displacement affects the interaction between Ser130 and the acidic group such as carboxylate and sulfonate of β-lactams.},

              CTX-M β-lactamases, which show a high cefotaxime hydrolytic activity, constitute the most prevalent extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) type found among clinical isolates. The recent explosive diversification of CTX-M enzymes seems to have taken place due to the appearance of more efficient enzymes which are capable of hydrolyzing both cefotaxime and ceftazidime, especially among the CTX-M-1 cluster.

              genes and site-directed mutagenesis has been used to evaluate the role of ceftazidime and other β-lactam antibiotics in triggering the diversity found among enzymes belonging to this cluster. Two types of mutants, P167S and D240G, displaying high ceftazidime MICs but reduced resistance to cefotaxime and/or cefepime, respectively, were identified. Such an antagonistic pleiotropic effect was particularly evident with P167S/T mutations. The incompatibility between P167S and D240G changes was demonstrated, since double mutants reduced susceptibility to both ceftazidime and cefotaxime-cefepime; this may explain the absence of strains containing both mutations in the clinical environment. The role of A77V and N106S mutations, which are frequently associated with P167S/T and/or D240G, respectively, in natural strains, was investigated. The presence of A77V and N106S contributes to restore a high-level cefotaxime resistance phenotype, but only when associated with mutations P167S and D240G, respectively. However, A77V mutation increases resistance to both cefotaxime and ceftazidime when associated with CTX-M-10. This suggests that in this context this mutation might be considered a primary site involved in resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins.},

              Infections due to carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative pathogens are associated with limited treatment options and consequently lead to increased mortality and morbidity. In response, combinations of existing β-lactams and novel β-lactamase inhibitors, such as ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI), have been developed as alternative treatment options. To understand the development of resistance and evolutionary trajectories under CAZ-AVI exposure, we studied the effects of ceftazidime (CAZ) and CAZ-AVI on the carbapenemase OXA-48 and the epidemic OXA-48 plasmid in
              Escherichia coli
              . Exposure of CAZ and CAZ-AVI resulted in single (P68A) and double (P68A,Y211S) amino acid substitutions in OXA-48, respectively. The antimicrobial susceptibility data and enzyme kinetics showed that the P68A substitution was responsible for an increased activity toward CAZ, whereas P68A,Y211S led to a decrease in the inhibitory activity of AVI. X-ray crystallography and molecular modeling of the mutants demonstrated increased flexibility within the active site, which could explain the elevated CAZ hydrolysis and reduced inhibitory activity of AVI. Interestingly, these substitutions resulted in collateral effects compromising the activity of OXA-48 toward carbapenems and penicillins. Moreover, exposure to CAZ-AVI selected for mutations within the OXA-48-encoding plasmid that severely reduced fitness in the absence of antimicrobial selection. These evolutionary trade-offs may contribute to limit the evolution of OXA-48-mediated CAZ and CAZ-AVI resistance, as well as potentially resensitize isolates toward other therapeutic alternatives.
            
            
              IMPORTANCE
              The recent introduction of novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations like ceftazidime-avibactam has increased our ability to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, including carbapenemase-producing
              Enterobacterales
              . However, the increasing number of cases of reported resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam is a concern. OXA-48 is a carbapenemase that has no significant effect on ceftazidime, but is inhibited by avibactam. Since isolates with OXA-48 frequently harbor extended-spectrum β-lactamases that are inhibited by avibactam, it is likely that ceftazidime-avibactam will be used to treat infections caused by OXA-48-producing
              Enterobacterales.
              Our data show that exposure to ceftazidime-avibactam can lead to changes in OXA-48, resulting in increased ability to hydrolyze ceftazidime and withstand the inhibitory effect of avibactam. Thus, resistance toward ceftazidime-avibactam among OXA-48-producing
              Enterobacterales
              should be monitored. Interestingly, the compromising effect of the amino acid substitutions in OXA-48 on other β-lactams and the effect of ceftazidime-avibactam exposure on the epidemic OXA-48 plasmid indicate that the evolution of ceftazidime-avibactam resistance comes with collateral effects.},

              Pseudomonas aeruginosa
              produces a class C β-lactamase (e.g., PDC-3) that robustly hydrolyzes early generation cephalosporins often at the diffusion limit; therefore, bacteria possessing these β-lactamases are resistant to many β-lactam antibiotics. In response to this significant clinical threat, ceftolozane, a 3′ aminopyrazolium cephalosporin, was developed. Combined with tazobactam, ceftolozane promised to be effective against multidrug-resistant
              P. aeruginosa
              . Alarmingly, Ω-loop variants of the PDC β-lactamase (V213A, G216R, E221K, E221G, and Y223H) were identified in ceftolozane/tazobactam-resistant
              P. aeruginosa
              clinical isolates. Herein, we demonstrate that the
              Escherichia coli
              strain expressing the E221K variant of PDC-3 had the highest minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against a panel of β-lactam antibiotics, including ceftolozane and ceftazidime, a cephalosporin that differs in structure largely in the R2 side chain. The
              k
              cat
              values of the E221K variant for both substrates were equivalent, whereas the
              
                K
                m
              
              for ceftolozane (341 &#177; 64 µM) was higher than that for ceftazidime (174 &#177; 20 µM). Timed mass spectrometry, thermal stability, and equilibrium unfolding studies revealed key mechanistic insights. Enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations identified conformational changes in the E221K variant Ω-loop, where a hidden pocket adjacent to the catalytic site opens and stabilizes ceftolozane for efficient hydrolysis. Encouragingly, the diazabicyclooctane β-lactamase inhibitor avibactam restored susceptibility to ceftolozane and ceftazidime in cells producing the E221K variant. In addition, a boronic acid transition state inhibitor, LP-06, lowered the ceftolozane and ceftazidime MICs by 8-fold for the E221K-expressing strain. Understanding these structural changes in evolutionarily selected variants is critical toward designing effective β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor therapies for
              P. aeruginosa
              infections.
            
            
              IMPORTANCE
              The presence of β-lactamases (e.g., PDC-3) that have naturally evolved and acquired the ability to break down β-lactam antibiotics (e.g., ceftazidime and ceftolozane) leads to highly resistant and potentially lethal
              Pseudomonas aeruginosa
              infections. We show that wild-type PDC-3 β-lactamase forms an acyl enzyme complex with ceftazidime, but it cannot accommodate the structurally similar ceftolozane that has a longer R2 side chain with increased basicity. A single amino acid substitution from a glutamate to a lysine at position 221 in PDC-3 (E221K) causes the tyrosine residue at 223 to adopt a new position poised for efficient hydrolysis of both cephalosporins. The importance of the mechanism of action of the E221K variant, in particular, is underscored by its evolutionary recurrences in multiple bacterial species. Understanding the biochemical and molecular basis for resistance is key to designing effective therapies and developing new β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations.},

This has relied on the development of algorithms that minimize or eliminate subjective input, the development of algorithms that automate procedures that are traditionally performed by hand and, finally, the development of a framework that allows a tight integration between the algorithms.},

              is a molecular-graphics application for model building and validation of biological macromolecules. The program displays electron-density maps and atomic models and allows model manipulations such as idealization, real-space refinement, manual rotation/translation, rigid-body fitting, ligand search, solvation, mutations, rotamers and Ramachandran idealization. Furthermore, tools are provided for model validation as well as interfaces to external programs for refinement, validation and graphics. The software is designed to be easy to learn for novice users, which is achieved by ensuring that tools for common tasks are `discoverable' through familiar user-interface elements (menus and toolbars) or by intuitive behaviour (mouse controls). Recent developments have focused on providing tools for expert users, with customisable key bindings, extensions and an extensive scripting interface. The software is under rapid development, but has already achieved very widespread use within the crystallographic community. The current state of the software is presented, with a description of the facilities available and of some of the underlying methods employed.},
