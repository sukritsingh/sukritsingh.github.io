title: Gibbs 2017 Takeaways

So this is long past overdue, but I wanted to write up some thoughts I had on Gibbs 2017, and how much fun it was to attend!! Attending a smaller conference like Gibbs always incredibly fun, not only are you getting a chance to see the same people again and reconnect, but it is a lot easier to bug faculty and try and improve your own visibility!


So anyways, without further ado, here is a very abridged list of my Gibbs 2017 highlights:

- I got to chair the session on "Binding Equilibria and Allostery"! I had no idea what to expect, but it actually turned out to be really fun!
- There were some great talks by Sarah Bondos and others highlighting how Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) has a bigger role to play in biology biophysics than we might have thought previously. Carlos Casta√±eda presented some really interesting work looking at phase separation and the role it can play in oligomerization and Alzheimer's disease!
- Sarah Bondos' also highlighted an important reminder: That sometimes science comes from unexpected things. She told a great story how she only noticed fibril formation and LLPS because she left a drop hanging from her column overnight!! Sometimes we just have to keep our eyes open on the small things we do!
