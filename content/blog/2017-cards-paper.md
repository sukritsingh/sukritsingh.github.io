After a decent amount of revision: the CARDS paper has officially been accepted!!!  

If anybody is interested in reading it, they can check it out [here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.6b01181). 
Now the fun comes! I'm excited to start applying all kinds of fun analyses 
to structure+disordered states, as well as testing CARDS on all kinds of new systems.

If you're reading this and are interested in using CARDS, 
shoot me an email or a message somewhere and we can get that ball rolling! 
I'm always excited to see what patterns CARDS can find!

Along with CARDS, I've also been lucky enough to help out on a number of projects that are
currently being written up, or have come out recently! 
One is a [project from my undergrad](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14767058.2016.1241763), 
but other papers are more relevant to my current work. One applies [docking models to rationalize differences in inhibitor activity](https://pubs.rsc.org/is/content/articlelanding/2017/cc/c6cc09882g#!divAbstract), 
and another is a combination of structural biology, functional assays, and molecular 
dynamics to elucidate [the mechanism of allostery in an Apoptosis Inducing Factor](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212616303033). 

In light of finally having both a first author publication AND other papers as a contributing author, I also decided to go ahead and make my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1IHMXzcAAAAJ&hl=en) profile public! 

Here's to more biophysical fun in the future!
