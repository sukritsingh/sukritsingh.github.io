Sometimes I like to tinker with a variety of different things.
Compiled here are some of those efforts, some of which are embedded:
{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="/side-projects/thesis/" 
  title="My thesis in HTML" 
  icon="book-open"
  >}}
  {{< card link="/side-projects/bevmap/" 
  title="My beverage rating map"
  icon="map"
  >}}
  {{< card link="/side-projects/molview/" 
  title="Interactive Traj Viewer"
  icon="video-camera"

  {{< card link="https://sukritsingh.github.io/bestiary/" 
  title="D&D 5e Bestiary and NPC database"
  icon="collection"

  {{< card link="https://sukritsingh.github.io/grimoire/"
