Sometimes I like to tinker with doing a variety of different ideas or mappings.
Here are posted some collection of those efforts, some of which are embedded:
{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="/side-projects/thesis/" 
  title="My thesis in HTML" 
  icon="book-open"
  >}}
  {{< card link="/side-projects/bevmap/" 
  title="My beverage rating map"
  icon="map"
  >}}
  {{< card link="/side-projects/molview/" 
  title="Interactive Traj Viewer"
  icon="video-camera"
  >}}
{{< /cards >}}
