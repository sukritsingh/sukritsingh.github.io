## Additional roles:
- I am a maintainer of the [MDTraj](http://mdtraj.readthedocs.io) python package, which is a widely used tool for analyzing molecular dynamics simulations.
- I help with science communication efforts as a team member of the [Folding@home](https://foldingathome.org) project. This includes
helping out with the twitter page as well as the [twitch stream](https://twitch.tv/foldingathomedotorg).

## Education: 
- PhD in [__Computational and Molecular Biophysics__](https://dbbs.wustl.edu/programs/biochemistry-biophysics-structural-biology/) with [Greg Bowman](https://bowmanlab.seas.upenn.edu/)
    - My thesis work developed approaches to parse protein allostery (how distant amino-acids impact one another) from MD simulations to explain biological mechanism 
    at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://biochem.wustl.edu/) ([Greg is now at UPenn](https://bowmanlab.seas.upenn.edu/)). 

- Bachelor's (BA) double majoring in __Chemistry and Biology__ 
from [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/) 
    - I trained jointly between [Jay Ponder](https://dasher.wustl.edu/) and 
    [Garland Marshall](https://biochem.wustl.edu/faculty/marshall) working on integrated 
    approaches to design peptidomimetics and synthesize better spectroscopic spin labels
    - I briefly trained in [Joe Dougherty's group](https://sites.wustl.edu/doughertylab/) as a freshman and sophomore
