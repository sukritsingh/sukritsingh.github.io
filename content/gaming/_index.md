One of my big hobbies, along with D&D, is playing video games and thinking about 
game design. Every so often I might post a review here about a game 
I particularly enjoyed (or didn't).

You're welcome to check out my Steam or Xbox Live profiles, but I mostly play on PC hardware. 

Sometimes, to help raise awareness, a few friends and I will stream our game nights on the [Folding@home twitch stream](twitch.tv/foldingathomedotorg).
