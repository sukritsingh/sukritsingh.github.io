<p><strong><em>Lightning Sword.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 40 (9d6+9) lightning damage.</p>

<p><strong><em>Windjavelin.</em></strong> The giant coalesces wind into a javeIin-like form and hurls it at a creature it can see within 600 feet of it. The javelin is considered a magic weapon and deals 19 (3d6+9) piercing damage to the target, striking unerringly. The javelin disappears after it hits.</p>

<p><strong>Legendary Actions</strong></p>

<p>The giant can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatureâ€™s turn. The giant regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>

<p><strong><em>Gust.</em></strong> The giant targets a creature it can see within 60 feet of it and creates a magical gust of wind around it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet in any horizontal direction the giant chooses.</p>

<p><strong><em>Thunderbolt (2 Actions).</em></strong> The giant hurls a thunderbolt at a creature it can see within 600 feet of it. The target must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

<p><strong><em>One with the Storm (3 Actions).</em></strong> The giant vanishes, dispersing itself into the storm surrounding its lair. The giant can end this effect at the start of any of its turns, becoming a giant once more and appearing in any location it chooses within its lair. While dispersed, the giant canâ€™t take any actions other than lair actions, and it canâ€™t be targeted by attacks, spells, or other effects. The giant canâ€™t use this ability outside its lair, nor can it use this ability if another creature is using a control weather spell or similar magic to quell the storm.</p>
