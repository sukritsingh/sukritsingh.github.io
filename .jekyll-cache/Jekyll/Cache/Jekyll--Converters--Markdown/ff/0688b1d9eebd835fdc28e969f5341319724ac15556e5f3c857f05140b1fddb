On a successful save, the creature is frightened until the end of its next turn.</p>

<p><strong><em>Life Drain.</em></strong> The demilich targets up to three creatures that it can see within 10 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or take 21 (6d6) necrotic damage, and the demilich regains hit points equal to the total damage dealt to all targets.</p>

<p><strong>Legendary Actions</strong></p>

<p>The demilich can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The demilich regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>

<p><strong><em>Flight.</em></strong> The demilich flies up to half its flying speed.</p>

<p><strong><em>Cloud of Dust.</em></strong> The demilich magically swirls its dusty remains. Each creature within 10 feet of the demilich, including around a corner, must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of the demilich’s next turn. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to this effect until the end of the demilich’s next turn.</p>

<p><strong><em>Energy Drain (Costs 2 Actions).</em></strong> Each creature with in 30 feet of the demilich must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s hit point maximum is magically reduced by 10 (3d6). If a creature’s hit point maximum is reduced to 0 by this effect, the creature dies. A creature’s hit point maximum can be restored with the greater restoration spell or similar magic.</p>

<p><strong><em>Vile Curse (Costs 3 Actions).</em></strong> The demilich targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically cursed. Until the curse ends, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws.
