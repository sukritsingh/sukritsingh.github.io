A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a targetâ€™s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this aura for the next 24 hours.</p>

<p><strong><em>Variant: Chameleon Skin.</em></strong> The yuan-ti has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.</p>

<p><strong><em>Variant: Shed Skin (1/Day).</em></strong> The yuan-ti can shed its skin as a bonus action to free itself from a grapple, shackles, or other restraints. If the yuan-ti spends 1 minute eating its shed skin, it regains hit points equal to half its hit point maximum.</p>
