<p><strong><em>Frightful Presence.</em></strong> Each creature of the dragonâ€™s choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creatureâ€™s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragonâ€™s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.</p>

<p><strong><em>Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6).</em></strong> The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.</p>

<p>Fire Breath. The dragon exhales fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

<p>Weakening Breath. The dragon exhales gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or have disadvantage on Strength-based attack rolls, Strength checks, and Strength saving throws for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>

<p><strong><em>Detect.</em></strong> The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>

<p><strong><em>Tail Attack.</em></strong> The dragon makes a tail attack.</p>

<p><strong><em>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).</em></strong> The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 ft. of the dragon must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.</p>
