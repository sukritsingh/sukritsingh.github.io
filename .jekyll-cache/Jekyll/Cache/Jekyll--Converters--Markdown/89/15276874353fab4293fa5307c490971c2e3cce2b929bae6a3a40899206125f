<p><strong>Skills</strong> Perception +2</p>

<p><strong>Damage Immunities</strong> bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons that arenâ€™t silvered</p>

<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common (canâ€™t speak in boar form)</p>

<p><strong>Challenge</strong> 4 (1,100 XP)</p>

<p><strong><em>Shapechanger.</em></strong> The wereboar can use its action to polymorph into a boar-humanoid hybrid or into a boar, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its AC, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isnâ€™t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</p>

<p><strong><em>Charge (Boar or Hybrid Form Only).</em></strong> If the wereboar moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with its tusks on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>

<p><strong><em>Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).</em></strong> If the wereboar takes 14 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead.</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Multiattack (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only).</em></strong> The wereboar makes two attacks, only one of which can be with its tusks.</p>

<p><strong><em>Maul (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only).</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage.</p>

<p><strong><em>Tusks (Boar or Hybrid Form Only).</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with wereboar lycanthropy.</p>
