<p><strong><em>Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</em></strong> If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.</p>

<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) lightning damage.</p>

<p><strong><em>Claw.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage.</p>

<p><strong><em>Tail.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.</p>

<p><strong><em>Frightful Presence.</em></strong> Each creature of the dragonâ€™s choice that is within 120 ft. of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creatureâ€™s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragonâ€™s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.</p>

<p><strong><em>Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6).</em></strong> The dragon exhales lightning in a 90-foot line that is 5 ft. wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

<p><strong>Legendary Actions</strong></p>

<p>The adult blue dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creatureâ€™s turn. The adult blue dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>

<p><strong><em>Detect.</em></strong> The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>

<p><strong><em>Tail Attack.</em></strong> The dragon makes a tail attack.</p>

<p><strong><em>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).</em></strong> The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 ft. of the dragon must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (2d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.</p>
