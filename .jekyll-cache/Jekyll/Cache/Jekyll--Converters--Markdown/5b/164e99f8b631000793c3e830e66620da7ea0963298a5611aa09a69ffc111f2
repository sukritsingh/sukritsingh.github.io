<p><strong><em>Amorphous.</em></strong> The pudding can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.</p>

<p><strong><em>Corrosive Form.</em></strong> A creature that touches the pudding or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) acid damage. Any nonmagical weapon made of metal or wood that hits the pudding corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal or wood that hits the pudding is destroyed after dealing damage. The pudding can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical wood or metal in 1 round.</p>

<p><strong><em>Spider Climb.</em></strong> The pudding can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</p>

In addition, nonmagical armor worn by the target is partly dissolved and takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10.</p>
