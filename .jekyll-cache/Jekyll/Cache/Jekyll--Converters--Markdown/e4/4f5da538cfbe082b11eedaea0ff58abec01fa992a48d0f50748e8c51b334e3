<p><strong><em>Angelic Weapons.</em></strong> The solarâ€™s weapon attacks are magical. When the solar hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 6d8 radiant damage (included in the attack).</p>

<p><strong><em>Divine Awareness.</em></strong> The solar knows if it hears a lie.</p>

<p><strong><em>Innate Spellcasting.</em></strong> The solarâ€™s spell casting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 25). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:</p>

<p>At will: detect evil and good, invisibility (self only)</p>

<p>3/day each: blade barrier, dispel evil and good, resurrection</p>

<p>1/day each: commune, control weather</p>

<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> The solar has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The solar makes two greatsword attacks.</p>

<p><strong><em>Greatsword.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (4d6 + 8) slashing damage plus 27 (6d8) radiant damage.</p>

<p><strong><em>Slaying Longbow.</em></strong> Ranged Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) piercing damage plus 27 (6d8) radiant damage. If the target is a creature that has 190 hit points or fewer, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or die.</p>

<p><strong><em>Flying Sword.</em></strong> The solar releases its greatsword to hover magically in an unoccupied space within 5 ft. of it. If the solar can see the sword, the solar can mentally command it as a bonus action to fly up to 50 ft. and either make one attack against a target or return to the solarâ€™s hands. If the hovering sword is targeted by any effect, the solar is considered to be holding it. The hovering sword falls if the solar dies.</p>

<p><strong><em>Healing Touch (4/Day).</em></strong> The solar touches another creature. The target magically regains 40 (8d8 + 4) hit points and is freed from any curse, disease, poison, blindness, or deafness.</p>

<p><strong>Legendary Actions</strong></p>

<p>The solar can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creatureâ€™s turn. The solar regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>

<p><strong><em>Teleport.</em></strong> The solar magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 ft. to an unoccupied space it can see.</p>

<p><strong><em>Searing Burst (Costs 2 Actions).</em></strong> The solar emits magical, divine energy. Each creature of its choice in a 10 -foot radius must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage plus 14 (4d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

<p><strong><em>Blinding Gaze (Costs 3 Actions).</em></strong> The solar targets one creature it can see within 30 ft. of it. If the target can see it, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until magic such as the lesser restoration spell removes the blindness.</p>
