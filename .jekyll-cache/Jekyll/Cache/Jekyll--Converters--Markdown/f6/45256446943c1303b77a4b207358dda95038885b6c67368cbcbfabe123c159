<p><strong><em>Shapechanger.</em></strong> The barghest can use its action to polymorph into a Small goblin or back into its true form. Other than its size and speed, its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isnâ€™t transformed. The barghest reverts to its true form if it dies.</p>

<p><strong><em>Fire Banishment.</em></strong> When the barghest starts its turn engulfed in flames that are at least 10 feet high or wide, it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be instantly banished to Gehenna. Instantaneous bursts of flame (such as a red dragonâ€™s breath or a fireball spell) donâ€™t have this effect on the barghest.</p>

<p><strong><em>Keen Smell.</em></strong> The barghest has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.</p>

<p><strong><em>Innate Spellcasting.</em></strong> The barghestâ€™s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components::</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>At will: levitate, minor illusion, pass without trace</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1/day each: charm person, dimension door, suggestion</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Soul Feeding.</em></strong> A barghest can feed on the corpse of a humanoid that it killed that has been dead for less than 10 minutes, devouring both flesh and soul in doing so. This feeding takes at least 1 minute, and it destroys the victimâ€™s body. The victimâ€™s soul is trapped in the barghest for 24 hours, after which time it is digested. If the barghest dies before the soul is digested, the soul is released.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While a humanoidâ€™s soul is trapped in a barghest, any form of revival that could work has only a 50 percent chance of doing so, freeing the soul from the barghest if it is successful. Once a creatureâ€™s soul is digested, however, no mortal magic can return that humanoid to life.</p>
