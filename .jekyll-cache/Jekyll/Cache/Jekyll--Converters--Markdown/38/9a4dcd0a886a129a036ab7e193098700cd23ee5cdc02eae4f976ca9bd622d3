<p><strong>Damage Immunities</strong> bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons that arenâ€™t silvered</p>

<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common (canâ€™t speak in jackal form)</p>

<p><strong><em>Shapechanger.</em></strong> The jackalwere can use its action to polymorph into a specific Medium human or a jackal-humanoid hybrid, or back into its true form (that of a Small jackal). Other than its size, its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn â€˜t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</p>

<p><strong><em>Keen Hearing and Smell.</em></strong> The jackalwere has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.</p>

<p><strong><em>Pack Tactics.</em></strong> The jackalwere has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the wolfâ€™s allies is within 5 ft. of the creature and the ally isnâ€™t incapacitated.</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Bite (Jackal or Hybrid Form Only).</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.</p>

<p><strong><em>Scimitar (Human or Hybrid Form Only).</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.</p>

<p><strong><em>Sleep Gaze.</em></strong> The jackalwere gazes at one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target succumbs to a magical slumber, falling unconscious for 10 minutes or until someone uses an action to shake the target awake. A creature that successfully saves against the effect is immune to this jackalwereâ€™s gaze for the next 24 hours. Undead and creatures immune to being charmed arenâ€™t affected by it.</p>
