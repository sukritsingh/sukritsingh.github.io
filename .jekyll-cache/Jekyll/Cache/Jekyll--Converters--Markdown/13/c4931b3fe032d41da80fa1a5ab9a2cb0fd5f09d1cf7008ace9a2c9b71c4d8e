<p><strong>Senses</strong> darkvision 120 ft.</p>

<p><strong>Challenge</strong> 2 (450 XP)</p>

<p><strong><em>Distress Spores.</em></strong> When the myconid takes damage, all other myconids within 240 feet of it can sense its pain.</p>

<p><strong><em>Sun Sickness.</em></strong> While in sunlight, the myconid has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The myconid dies if it spends more than 1 hour in direct sunlight.</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The myconid uses either its Hallucination Spores or its Pacifying Spores, then makes a fist attack.</p>

<p><strong><em>Fist.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (3d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (3d4) poison damage.</p>

<p><strong><em>Animating Spores.</em></strong> The myconid targets one corpse of a humanoid or a Large or smaller beast within 5 feet of it and releases spores at the corpse. In 24 hours, the corpse rises as a spore servant. The corpse stays animated for 1d4 + 1 weeks or until destroyed, and it can’t be animated again in this way.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hallucination Spores.</em></strong> The myconid ejects spores at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target is incapacitated while it hallucinates. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>

<p><strong><em>Pacifying Spores.</em></strong> The myconid ejects spores at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>

<p><strong><em>Rapport Spores.</em></strong> A 30-foot radius of spores extends from the myconid. These spores can go around corners and affect only creatures with an Intelligence of 2 or higher that aren’t undead, constructs, or elementals. Affected creatures can communicate telepathically with one another while they are within 30 feet of each other. The effect lasts for 1 hour.</p>
