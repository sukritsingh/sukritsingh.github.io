<p><strong><em>Discorporation.</em></strong> When Tiamat drops to 0 hit points or dies, her body is destroyed but her essence travels back to her domain in the Nine Hells, and she is unable to take physical form for a time.</p>

<p><strong><em>Innate Spellcasting (3/Day).</em></strong> Tiamat can innately cast divine word (spell save DC 26). Her spellcasting ability is Charisma.</p>

<p><strong><em>Legendary Resistance (5/Day).</em></strong> If Tiamat fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.</p>

<p><strong><em>Limited Magic Immunity.</em></strong> Unless she wishes to be affected, Tiamat is immune to spells of 6th level or lower. She has advantage on saving throws against all other spells and magical effects.</p>

<p><strong><em>Magic Weapons.</em></strong> Tiamatâ€™s weapon attacks are magical.</p>

<p><strong><em>Multiple Heads.</em></strong> Tiamat can take one reaction per turn, rather than only one per round. She also has advantage on saving throws against being knocked unconscious. If she fails a saving throw against an effect that would stun a creature, one of her unspent legendary actions is spent.</p>

<p><strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> Tiamat regains 30 hit points at the start of her turn.</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Tiamat can use her Frightful Presence. She then makes three attacks: two with her claws and one with her tail.</p>

<p><strong><em>Tail.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 25 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (4d8 + 10) piercing damage.</p>

<p><strong><em>Frightful Presence.</em></strong> Each creature of Tiamatâ€™s choice that is within 240 feet of Tiamat and aware of her must succeed on a DC 26 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creatureâ€™s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Tiamatâ€™s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Legendary Actions</strong></p>

<p>The tiamat can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creatureâ€™s turn. The tiamat regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>

<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> Tiamat can take 5 legendary actions, choosing from the options listed. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatureâ€™s turn. Tiamat regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.</p>

<p>Tiamatâ€™s legendary action options are associated with her five dragon heads (a bite and a breath weapon for each). Once Tiamat chooses a legendary action option for one of her heads, she canâ€™t choose another one associated with that head until the start of her next turn.</p>
