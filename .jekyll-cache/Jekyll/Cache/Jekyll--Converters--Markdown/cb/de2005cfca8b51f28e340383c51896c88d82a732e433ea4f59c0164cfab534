If the duergar lacks the room to become Large, it attains the maximum size possible in the space available.</p>

<p><strong><em>Create Soulblade.</em></strong> The duergar creates a visible, shortword-sized blade of psionic energy. The weapon appears int he duergar’s hand and vanishes if it leaves the duergar’s grip, or if the duergar dies or is incapacitated.</p>

<p><strong><em>Soulblade.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attackk: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) force damage, or 10 (2d6 + 3) force damage while enlarged. If the soulblade has advantage on the attack roll, the attack deals an extra 3 (1d6) force damage.</p>
