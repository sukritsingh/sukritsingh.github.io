<p><strong><em>Magic Weapons.</em></strong> The sphinxâ€™s weapon attacks are magical.</p>

<p><strong><em>Spellcasting.</em></strong> The sphinx is a 12th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). It requires no material components to cast its spells. The sphinx has the following cleric spells prepared:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Cantrips (at will): sacred flame, spare the dying, thaumaturgy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1st level (4 slots): command, detect evil and good, detect magic</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2nd level (3 slots): lesser restoration, zone of truth</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>4th level (3 slots): banishment, freedom of movement</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The sphinx makes two claw attacks.</p>

<p><strong><em>Claw.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing damage.</p>

<p><strong><em>Roar (3/Day).</em></strong> The sphinx emits a magical roar. Each time it roars before finishing a long rest, the roar is louder and the effect is different, as detailed below. Each creature within 500 feet of the sphinx and able to hear the roar must make a saving throw.</p>

<p>First Roar. Each creature that fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw is frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>

<p>Second Roar. Each creature that fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw is deafened and frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature is paralyzed and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>

<p>Third Roar. Each creature makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 44 (8d10) thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t knocked prone.</p>
