The wand regains 1d4 + 3 charges daily at dawn.</p>

<p>While holding the wand, Orcus gains +3 AC and can use an action to conjure undead creatures whose combined average hit points donâ€™t exceed 500, These undead magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of Orcus and obey his commands until they are destroyed or until he dismisses them as an action.
