<p><strong><em>Weapon Invention.</em></strong> The kobold uses one of the following options (roll a d8 or choose one); the kobold can use each one no more than once per day:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Acid. The kobold hurls a flask of acid. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) acid damage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alchemistâ€™s fire. The kobold throws a flask of alchemistâ€™s fire. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: 2 (1d4) fire damage at the start of each of the targetâ€™s turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basket of Centipedes. The kobold throws a small basket into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A swarm of insects (centipedes) with 11 hit points emerges from the basket and rolls initiative. At the end of each of the swarmâ€™s turns, thereâ€™s a 50 percent chance that the swarm disperses.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Green Slime Pot. The kobold throws a clay pot full of green slime at the target, and it breaks open on impact. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: The target is covered in a patch of green slime (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon Masterâ€™s Guide). Miss: A patch of green slime covers a randomly determined 5-foot-square section of wall or floor within 5 feet of the target.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rot Grub Pot. The kobold throws a clay pot into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it, and it breaks open on impact. A swarm of rot grubs (see appendix A) emerges from the shattered pot and remains a hazard in that square.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scorpion on a Stick. The kobold makes a melee attack with a scorpion tied to the end of a 5-foot-long pole. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Skunk in a Cage. The kobold releases a skunk into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The skunk has a walking speed of 20 feet, AC 10, 1 hit point, and no effective attacks. It rolls initiative and, on its turn, uses its action to spray musk at a random creature within 5 feet of it. The target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target retches and canâ€™t take actions for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that doesnâ€™t need to breathe or is immune to poison automatically succeeds on the saving throw. Once the skunk has sprayed its musk, it canâ€™t do so again until it finishes a short or long rest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wasp Nest in a Bag. The kobold throws a small bag into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A swarm of insects (wasps) with 11 hit points emerges from the bag and rolls initiative. At the end of each of the swarmâ€™s turns, thereâ€™s a 50 percent chance that the swarm disperses.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
