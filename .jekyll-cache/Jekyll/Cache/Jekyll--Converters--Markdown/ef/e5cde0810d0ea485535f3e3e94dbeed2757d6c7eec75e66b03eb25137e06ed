<p><strong><em>Shapechanger.</em></strong> The yuan-ti can use its action to polymorph into a Medium snake or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isnâ€™t transformed. It doesnâ€™t change form if it dies.</p>

<p><strong><em>Innate Spellcasting (Yuan-ti Form Only).</em></strong> The yuan-tiâ€™s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). The yuan-ti can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:</p>

<p>At will: animal friendship (snakes only) 3/day: suggestion</p>

<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> The yuan-ti has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>

<p><strong><em>Poisonâ€™s Disciple (2/Day).</em></strong> The first time the yuan-ti hits with a melee attack on its turn, it can deal an extra 16 (3d10) poison damage to the target.</p>

<p><strong><em>Spellcasting (Yuan-ti Farm Only).</em></strong> The yuan-ti is a 6th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It regains its expended spell slots when it finishes a short or long rest. It knows the following warlock spells:</p>

<p>Cantrips (at will): eldritch blast (range 300 ft., +3 bonus to each damage roll), friends, guidance, mage hand, message, poison spray</p>

<p>1st-3rd level (2 3rd-level slots): command, counterspell, hellish rebuke, invisibility, misty step, unseen servant, vampiric touch</p>

<p><strong><em>Variant: Chameleon Skin.</em></strong> The yuan-ti has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.</p>

<p><strong><em>Variant: Shed Skin (1/Day).</em></strong> The yuan-ti can shed its skin as a bonus action to free itself from a grapple, shackles, or other restraints. If the yuan-ti spends 1 minute eating its shed skin, it regains hit points equal to half its hit point maximum.</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Multiattack (Yuan-ti Form Only).</em></strong> The yuan-ti makes two bite attacks using its snake arms.</p>

<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4+3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.</p>

<p><strong><em>Merrshaulkâ€™s Slumber (1/Day).</em></strong> The yuan-ti targets up to five creatures that it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or fall into a magical sleep and be unconscious for 10 minutes. A sleeping target awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. This magical sleep has no effect on a creature immune to being charmed.</p>
