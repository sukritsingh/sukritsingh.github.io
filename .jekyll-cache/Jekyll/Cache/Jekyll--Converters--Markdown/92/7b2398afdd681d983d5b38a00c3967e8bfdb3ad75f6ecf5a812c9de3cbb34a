<p><strong>Challenge</strong> 5 (1,800 XP)</p>

<p><strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> The spawn of Kyuss regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isnâ€™t in sunlight or a body of running water. If the spawn takes acid, fire, or radiant damage, this trait doesnâ€™t function at the start of the spawnâ€™s next turn. The spawn is destroyed only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesnâ€™t regenerate.</p>

<p><strong><em>Worms.</em></strong> If the spawn of Kyuss is targeted by an effect that cures disease or removes a curse, all the worms infesting it wither away, and it loses its Burrowing Worm action.</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The spawn of Kyuss makes two attacks with its claws and uses Burrowing Worm.</p>

<p><strong><em>Burrowing Worm.</em></strong> A worm launches from the spawn of Kyuss at one humanoid that the spawn can see within 10 feet of it. The worm latches onto the targetâ€™s skin unless the target succeeds on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. The worm is a Tiny undead with AC 6, 1 hit point, a 2 (-4) in every ability score, and a speed of 1 foot. While on the targetâ€™s skin, the worm can be killed by normal means or scraped off using an action (the spawn can use this action to launch a scraped-off worm at a humanoid it can see within 10 feet of the worm). Otherwise, the worm burrows under the targetâ€™s skin at the end of the targetâ€™s next turn, dealing l piercing damage to it. At the end of each of its turns thereafter, the target takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage per worm infesting it (maximum of 10d6). A worm-infested target dies if it drops to 0 hit points, then rises 10 minutes later as a spawn of Kyuss. If a worm-infested creature is targeted by an effect that cures disease or removes a curse, all the worms infesting it wither away.</p>

<p><strong><em>Claw.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6+3) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.</p>
