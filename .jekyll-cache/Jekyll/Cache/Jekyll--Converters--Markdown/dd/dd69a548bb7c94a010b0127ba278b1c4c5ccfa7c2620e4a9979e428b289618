<p><strong><em>Air Form</em></strong> Yan-C-Bin can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. He can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing if air could pass through that space.</p>

<p><strong><em>Empowered Attacks.</em></strong> Yan-C-Bin’s slam attacks are treated as magical for the purpose of bypassing resistance and immunity to nonmagical weapons.</p>

<p><strong><em>Innate Spellcasting.</em></strong> Yan-C-Bin’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 20, +12 to hit with spell attacks). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>At will: gust of wind, invisibility, lightning bolt</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2/day each: chain lightning, cloudkill, haste</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</em></strong> If Yan-C-Bin fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.</p>

<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> Yan-C-Bin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Yan-C-Bin makes two slam attacks.</p>

<p><strong><em>Slam.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d8 + 7) force damage plus 10 (3d6) lightning damage.</p>

<p><strong><em>Thundercrack (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).</em></strong>  Yan-C-Bin unleashes a terrible thundercrack in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on himself. All other creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or take 31 (9d6) thunder damage and be deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is deafened until the start of Yan-C-Bin’s next turn.</p>

<p><strong><em>Change Shape.</em></strong> Yan-C-Bin polymorphs into a Medium humanoid. While in polymorphed form, a swirling breeze surrounds him, his eyes are pale and cloudy, and he loses the Air Form trait. He can remain in polymorphed form for up to 1 hour. Reverting to his true form requires an action.</p>

<p><strong><em>Summon Elementals (1/Day).</em></strong> Yan-C-Bin summons up to three air elementals and loses 30 hit points for each elemental he summons. Summoned elementals have maximum hit points, appear within 100 feet of Yan-C-Bin, and disappear if Yan-C-Bin is reduced to 0 hit points.</p>

<p><strong>Legendary Actions</strong></p>

<p>Yan-C-Bin can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Yan-C-Bin regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>

<p><strong><em>Peal of Thunder.</em></strong> Yan-C-Bin unleashes a peal of thunder that can be heard out to a range of 300 feet. Each creature within 30 feet of Yan-C-Bin takes 5 (1d10) thunder damage.</p>

<p><strong><em>Teleport (Costs 2 Actions).</em></strong> Yan-C-Bin magically teleports up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space he can see. Anything Yan-CBin is wearing or carrying is teleported with him.</p>

<p><strong><em>Suffocate (Costs 3 Actions).</em></strong> Yan-C-Bin steals the air of one breathing creature he can see within 60 feet of him. The target must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target drops to 0 hit points and is dying. On a successful save, the target can’t breathe or speak until the start of its next turn.</p>
