<p><strong><em>Source.</em></strong> tales from the yawning portal,  page 240</p>

<p><strong><em>Amphibious.</em></strong> The nereid can breathe air and water.</p>

<p><strong><em>Aquatic Invisibility.</em></strong> If immersed in water, the nereid can make itself invisible as a bonus action. It remains invisible until it leaves the water, ends the invisibility as a bonus action, or dies.</p>

<p><strong><em>Mantle Dependent.</em></strong> The nereid wears a mantle of silky cloth the color of sea foam, which holds the creatureâ€™s spirit. The mantle has an AC and hit points equal to that of the nereid, but the garment canâ€™t be directly harmed while the nereid wears it. If the mantle is destroyed, the nereid becomes poisoned and dies within 1 hour. A nereid is willing to do anything in its power to recover the mantle if it is stolen, including serving the thief.</p>

<p><strong><em>Shape Water.</em></strong> The nereid can cast control water at will, requiring no components. Its spellcasting ability for it is Charisma. This use of the spell has a range of 30 feet and can affect a cube of water no larger than 30 feet on a side.</p>

<p><strong><em>Speak with Animals.</em></strong> The nereid can comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts.</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Blinding Acid.</em></strong> Melee or Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d12 + 3) acid damage, and the target is blinded until the start of the nereidâ€™s next turn.</p>

<p><strong><em>Drowning Kiss (Recharge 5-6).</em></strong> The nereid touches one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 22 (3d12 + 3) acid damage. On a failure, it also runs out of breath and canâ€™t speak for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, it can repeat the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>

<p><strong><em>Water Lash.</em></strong> The nereid causes a 5-foot cube of water within 60 feet of it to take a shape of its choice and strike one target it can see within 5 feet of that water. The target must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 17 (4d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and ifit is a Large or smaller creature, it is pushed up to 15 feet in a straight line or is knocked prone (nereidâ€™s choice). On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t pushed or knocked prone.</p>
