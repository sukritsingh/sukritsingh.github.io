<p><strong><em>Elemental Demise.</em></strong> If the efreeti dies, its body disintegrates in a flash of fire and puff of smoke, leaving behind only equipment the djinni was wearing or carrying.</p>

<p><strong><em>Innate Spellcasting.</em></strong> The efreetiâ€™s innate spell casting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:</p>

<p>At will: detect magic</p>

<p>3/day: enlarge/reduce, tongues</p>

<p>1/day each: conjure elemental (fire elemental only), gaseous form, invisibility, major image, plane shift, wall of fire</p>

<p><strong><em>Variant: Genie Powers.</em></strong> Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.</p>

<p>Disguises.</p>

<p>Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.</p>

<p>Wishes.</p>

<p>The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isnâ€™t a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it canâ€™t grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creatureâ€™s existence.</p>

<p>To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creatureâ€™s behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genieâ€™s nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wishâ€™s poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genieâ€™s benefit.</p>
