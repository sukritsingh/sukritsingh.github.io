<p><strong>Condition Immunities</strong> petrified</p>

<p><strong>Senses</strong> darkvision 120 ft.</p>

<p><strong>Languages</strong> Terran</p>

<p><strong>Challenge</strong> 11 (7,200 XP)</p>

<p><strong><em>Earth Glide.</em></strong> The dao can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While doing so, the dao doesnâ€™t disturb the material it moves through.</p>

<p><strong><em>Elemental Demise.</em></strong> If the dao dies, its body disintegrates into crystalline powder, leaving behind only equipment the dao was wearing or carrying.</p>

<p><strong><em>Innate Spellcasting.</em></strong> The daoâ€™s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:</p>

<p>At will: detect evil and good, detect magic, stone shape</p>

<p>3/day each: passwall, move earth, tongues</p>

<p>1/day each: conjure elemental (earth elemental only), gaseous form, invisibility, phantasmal killer, plane shift, wall of stone</p>

<p><strong><em>Sure-Footed.</em></strong> The dao has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it prone.</p>

<p><strong><em>Variant: Genie Powers.</em></strong> Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.</p>

<p>Disguises.</p>

<p>Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.</p>

<p>Wishes.</p>

<p>The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isnâ€™t a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it canâ€™t grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creatureâ€™s existence.</p>

<p>To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creatureâ€™s behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genieâ€™s nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wishâ€™s poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genieâ€™s benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The Dao makes two fist attacks or two maul attacks.</p>

<p><strong><em>Fist.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.</p>

<p><strong><em>Maul.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (4d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength check or be knocked prone.</p>
