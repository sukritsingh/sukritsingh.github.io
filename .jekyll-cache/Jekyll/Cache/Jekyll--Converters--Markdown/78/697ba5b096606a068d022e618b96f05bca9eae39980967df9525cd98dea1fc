<p><strong><em>Death Throes.</em></strong> When the balor dies, it explodes, and each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects in that area that arenâ€™t being worn or carried, and it destroys the balorâ€™s weapons.</p>

<p><strong><em>Fire Aura.</em></strong> At the start of each of the balorâ€™s turns, each creature within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage, and flammable objects in the aura that arenâ€™t being worn or carried ignite. A creature that touches the balor or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.</p>

<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> The balor has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>

<p><strong><em>Magic Weapons.</em></strong> The balorâ€™s weapon attacks are magical.</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The balor makes two attacks: one with its longsword and one with its whip.</p>

<p><strong><em>Longsword.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d8 + 8) slashing damage plus 13 (3d8) lightning damage. If the balor scores a critical hit, it rolls damage dice three times, instead of twice.</p>

<p><strong><em>Whip.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) fire damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 25 feet toward the balor.</p>

<p><strong><em>Teleport.</em></strong> The balor magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.</p>

<p><strong><em>Variant: Summon Demon (1/Day).</em></strong> The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.</p>

<p>A balor has a 50 percent chance of summoning 1d8 vrocks, 1d6 hezrous, 1d4 glabrezus, 1d3 nalfeshnees, 1d2 mariliths, or one goristro.</p>

<p>A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and canâ€™t summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.</p>
