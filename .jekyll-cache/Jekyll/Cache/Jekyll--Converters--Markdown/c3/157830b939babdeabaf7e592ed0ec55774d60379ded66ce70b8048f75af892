<p><strong><em>Amphibious.</em></strong> The aboleth can breathe air and water.</p>

<p><strong><em>Mucous Cloud.</em></strong> While underwater, the aboleth is surrounded by transformative mucus. A creature that touches the aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 ft. of it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is diseased for 1d4 hours. The diseased creature can breathe only underwater.</p>

<p><strong><em>Probing Telepathy.</em></strong> If a creature communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the aboleth learns the creatureâ€™s greatest desires if the aboleth can see the creature.</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The aboleth makes three tentacle attacks.</p>

<p><strong><em>Tentacle.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The disease has no effect for 1 minute and can be removed by any magic that cures disease. After 1 minute, the diseased creatureâ€™s skin becomes translucent and slimy, the creature canâ€™t regain hit points unless it is underwater, and the disease can be removed only by heal or another disease-curing spell of 6th level or higher. When the creature is outside a body of water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to the skin before 10 minutes have passed.</p>

<p><strong><em>Tail.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft. one target. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.</p>

<p><strong><em>Enslave (3/day).</em></strong> The aboleth targets one creature it can see within 30 ft. of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by the aboleth until the aboleth dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from the target. The charmed target is under the abolethâ€™s control and canâ€™t take reactions, and the aboleth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance.</p>

<p>Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from the aboleth.</p>

<p><strong>Legendary Actions</strong></p>

<p>The aboleth can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creatureâ€™s turn. The aboleth regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>

<p><strong><em>Detect.</em></strong> The aboleth makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>

<p><strong><em>Tail Swipe.</em></strong> The aboleth makes one tail attack.</p>

<p><strong><em>Psychic Drain (Costs 2 Actions).</em></strong> One creature charmed by the aboleth takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage, and the aboleth regains hit points equal to the damage the creature takes.</p>
