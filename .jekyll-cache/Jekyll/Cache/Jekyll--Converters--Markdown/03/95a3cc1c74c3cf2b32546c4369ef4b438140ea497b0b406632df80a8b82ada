<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> The mummy lord has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>

<p><strong><em>Rejuvenation.</em></strong> A destroyed mummy lord gains a new body in 24 hours if its heart is intact, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the mummy lordâ€™s heart.</p>

<p><strong><em>Spellcasting.</em></strong> The mummy lord is a 10th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). The mummy lord has the following cleric spells prepared:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Cantrips (at will): sacred flame, thaumaturgy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1st level (4 slots): command, guiding bolt, shield of faith</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2nd level (3 slots): hold person, silence, spiritual weapon</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3rd level (3 slots): animate dead, dispel magic</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>4th level (3 slots): divination, guardian of faith</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>5th level (2 slots): contagion, insect plague</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>6th level (1 slot): harm</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The mummy can use its Dreadful Glare and makes one attack with its rotting fist.</p>

<p><strong><em>Rotting Fist.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 21 (6d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target canâ€™t regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the targetâ€™s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or other magic.</p>

<p><strong><em>Dreadful Glare.</em></strong> The mummy lord targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can see the mummy lord, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened until the end of the mummyâ€™s next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies and mummy lords for the next 24 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Legendary Actions</strong></p>

<p>The mummy lord can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creatureâ€™s turn. The mummy lord regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>

<p><strong><em>Attack.</em></strong> The mummy lord makes one attack with its rotting fist or uses its Dreadful Glare.</p>

<p><strong><em>Blinding Dust.</em></strong> Blinding dust and sand swirls magically around the mummy lord. Each creature within 5 feet of the mummy lord must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of the creatureâ€™s next turn.</p>

<p><strong><em>Blasphemous Word (Costs 2 Actions).</em></strong> The mummy lord utters a blasphemous word. Each non-undead creature within 10 feet of the mummy lord that can hear the magical utterance must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of the mummy lordâ€™s next turn.</p>

<p><strong><em>Channel Negative Energy (Costs 2 Actions).</em></strong> The mummy lord magically unleashes negative energy. Creatures within 60 feet of the mummy lord, including ones behind barriers and around corners, canâ€™t regain hit points until the end of the mummy lordâ€™s next turn.</p>

<p><strong><em>Whirlwind of Sand (Costs 2 Actions).</em></strong> The mummy lord magically transforms into a whirlwind of sand, moves up to 60 feet, and reverts to its normal form. While in whirlwind form, the mummy lord is immune to all damage, and it canâ€™t be grappled, petrified, knocked prone, restrained, or stunned. Equipment worn or carried by the mummy lord remain in its possession.</p>
