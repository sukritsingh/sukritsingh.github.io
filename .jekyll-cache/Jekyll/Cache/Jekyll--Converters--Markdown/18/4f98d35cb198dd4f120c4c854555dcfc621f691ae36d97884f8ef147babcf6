<p><strong>Skills</strong> Perception +4, Stealth +5</p>

<p><strong>Senses</strong> darkvision 60 ft.</p>

<p><strong>Languages</strong> Elvish, Sylvan</p>

<p><strong>Challenge</strong> 1 (200 XP)</p>

<p><strong><em>Innate Spellcasting.</em></strong> The dryadâ€™s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). The dryad can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:</p>

<p>At will: druidcraft</p>

<p>3/day each: entangle, goodberry</p>

<p>1/day each: barkskin, pass without trace, shillelagh</p>

<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> The dryad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>

<p><strong><em>Speak with Beasts and Plants.</em></strong> The dryad can communicate with beasts and plants as if they shared a language.</p>

<p><strong><em>Tree Stride.</em></strong> Once on her turn, the dryad can use 10 ft. of her movement to step magically into one living tree within her reach and emerge from a second living tree within 60 ft. of the first tree, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 ft. of the second tree. Both trees must be large or bigger.</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Club.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit (+6 to hit with shillelagh), reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2 (1 d4) bludgeoning damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage with shillelagh.</p>

<p><strong><em>Fey Charm.</em></strong> The dryad targets one humanoid or beast that she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the dryad, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed. The charmed creature regards the dryad as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isnâ€™t under the dryadâ€™s control, it takes the dryadâ€™s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can.</p>

<p>Each time the dryad or its allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the dryad dies, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If a targetâ€™s saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the dryadâ€™s Fey Charm for the next 24 hours.</p>

<p>The dryad can have no more than one humanoid and up to three beasts charmed at a time.</p>
