<!-- l. 5 --><p class='noindent'>When I was younger I somehow found myself constantly going back and forth trying to figure out my
favorite subject in science class: biology, chemistry, or physics. This dissertation is the
culmination of that debate, born out of a desire to integrate all my interests, and is a dream come
true.
</p><!-- l. 7 --><p class='noindent'>This thesis would not have been possible without the help of many mentors, family members, friends,
and colleagues. There are too many people to thank; if you are reading this, know that I am grateful
for your support and contributions.
</p><!-- l. 9 --><p class='noindent'>Primary thanks go to my mentor Gregory Bowman for pushing me to be the best scientist I can be.
Greg gave me the freedom to explore the boundaries of science and the mentoring to grow both as a
person and as a scientist. It is fun to reminisce on how we first met when the lab was still covered in
cardboard, and the wild journey we’ve been on since. My present and future success is in large part
because of him.
</p><!-- l. 11 --><p class='noindent'>Science can feel like a solo endeavor, but I have been lucky enough to be surrounded by lab members,
both past and present, that made me feel like part of a team. I am grateful for the time I got to
spend with Xianqiang (Leos) Sun, who I worked closely with on the G protein projects and
learned much about computational biophysics from. I also want to thank Katie Hart and
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
Chris Ho, whose advice and guidance during their time in the lab was invaluable. A special
thanks goes to Thomas Frederick, for being both an incredible colleague and a wonderful
friend. Spending time after hours reading papers or arguing about data was a perfect blend
of fun and insightful. It has also been a joy working with Neha Vithani on subsequent G
protein projects. Neha has been a fount of positivity and support for me, providing both
personal and scientific advice on all occasions. I am forever grateful for her patience with me
pinging her with a tidal wave of questions. Working alongside friends like Matthew Cruz and
Catie Knoverek has been an incredibly rewarding experience; Their unconditional love and
support kept me going when I struggled and getting to spend time with them, both in the
lab and outside, has brought me nothing but joy. It has been a pleasure to grow and learn
alongside Maxwell Zimmerman, who joined the lab at the same time I did, and so became my
“brother” in the lab. I am grateful to Justin Porter and Mickey Ward for all our wonderful
discussions that would range from science to the news to economic systems. I enjoyed
spending time with newer members of the lab Artur Meller, Upasana Mallimadugula, Jonathan
Borowsky, and Catherine Kuhn, who are doing incredible work and have taught me much in a
short time. Lastly, I wish to thank my two “Bay buddies” from when I first started in the
lab, Carrie Sibbald and subsequently Katie Moeder. Every conversation with either of
you was an enriching experience and made me a better scientist (and arguably a better
person).
</p><!-- l. 13 --><p class='noindent'>I want to thank my thesis committee (Linda Pike, Ken Blumer, Jay Ponder, Rohit Pappu, and Janice
Robertson) for their mentorship and advice throughout my graduate career. They, along with
other faculty members in my department, served as sources of mentorship and insight into
a life in science and research. I particularly want to thank Ken Blumer and Jay Ponder,
who over multiple conversations gave me tons of advice about an academic career and
my career trajectory. Jay, along with Garland Marshall, has been a long-time supporter
of mine since my undergraduate years, and I will forever be grateful for his support and
mentorship.
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
</p><!-- l. 15 --><p class='noindent'>I am grateful to have been a part of the Folding@home (F@h) consortium. Getting to discuss science
and F@h logistics with PIs and fellow F@h scientists has been an incredibly enriching experience. I
learned so much about managing an organization like F@h thanks to Anton Thynell, and about
engineering a network of this scale thanks to Joseph Coffland. A big shout-out goes to all the testers,
citizen-scientists, and volunteers that have been a part of Folding@home. Without you, this thesis
would literally not have been possible. Discussing science and troubleshooting simulations and
projects with testers on Slack and our forums made me feel like they were a part of the
lab.
</p><!-- l. 17 --><p class='noindent'>This thesis was possible thanks to support, financial and otherwise, from a variety of sources. I
want to thank the National Institutes of Health, the Division of Biological and Biomedical
Sciences (DBBS), and Millipore-Sigma for providing much of my graduate funding. Also a
quick shoutout to NVIDIA for providing a GTX Titan X to the lab, which was useful for
preliminary simulations. I also want to thank the Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics
(BMB) department for the opportunities to be involved in department events through my
time on the Student Liaison Committee, and for all the free coffee (that directly led to this
thesis). A <span class='ptmb7t-x-x-120'>big </span>thank-you to the admin folks in the BMB department, the DBBS program, and
the OISS office. They helped my graduate school experience go smoothly and without
any major hitches. They have been nothing but helpful and provided resources at every
turn.
</p><!-- l. 19 --><p class='noindent'>Having a support network is critical to surviving graduate school, and I would not have
been able to complete this thesis without the support of my friends. To Alex Bernstein,
Daniel Deibler, Scott Haber, Jack Reidy, and Sid Ravishankar: Thank you for all the years
of listening to me talk about science, your unending support when I struggled, and all
the endless fun we’ve had over the years. Thanks to my St. Louis D&amp;D group (Hannah,
Jeffrey, Shawn, Anthony, Charley, and River) for all the fun times over the years. Shout out
to Becky Ye for all the fulfilling conversations, and to my friends Jake Lyonfields and
Ashley Kuykendall for their support and advocacy; I am a better person because of all
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
that you opened my eyes to. Lastly, a big shout-out goes to friends and colleagues in my
graduate program (Tyson, Robb, Kacey, Jim, Josh, and Jessey) and beyond (Joseph H.,
Matt H., Rafal W.) for the years of great conversations, fun discussions, and incredible
memories.
</p><!-- l. 21 --><p class='noindent'>I want to give a thank you to the teachers I have had from Singapore American School, American
Embassy School (New Delhi), and my undergraduate years at Washington University. I
would not be here without the education and direction you provided me. Thank you to Ms.
Jain, Ms. Sosa, Mr. Brakenhoff, Mr. Ortiz, and many others who taught me through the
years.
</p><!-- l. 23 --><p class='noindent'>I am grateful to my mom and dad for literally making this thesis possible, and for showing me a world
of different cultures and opening my mind to new perspectives. A big shout-out goes to my cousins
Kshitij (Conny) and Kapun, who have been nothing but loving and supportive since the day I was
born. Final thanks go to my partner Sophia Fox-Dichter for her unending love and support. This thesis
is as much her effort as it is mine.
</p><!-- l. 25 --><p class='noindent'>Bonus thanks go to Coco the dog. You have put more into this thesis than you will ever comprehend.
You are a good girl.

<!-- l. 23 --><p class='noindent'>Protein conformational landscapes contain much of the functionally relevant information that is useful
for understanding biological processes at the chemical scale. Understanding and mapping out these
conformational landscapes can provide valuable insight into protein behaviors and biological
phenomena, and has relevance to the process of therapeutic design.
</p><!-- l. 25 --><p class='noindent'>While structural biology methods have been transformative in studying protein dynamics, they are
limited by technical limitations and have inherent resolution limits. Molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations are a powerful tool for exploring conformational landscapes, and provide atomic-scale
information that is useful in understanding protein behaviors. With recent advances in generating
datasets of large timescale simulations (using Folding@home) and powerful methods to interpret
conformational landscapes such as Markov State Models (MSMs), it is now possible to study complex
biological phenomena and long-timescale processes. However, inferring communication
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
between residues across long distances, referred to as allosteric communication, remains a
challenge.
</p><!-- l. 27 --><p class='noindent'>Allostery is a ubiquitious biological phenomena by which two distant regions of a protein are coupled
to one another over large distances. Allosteric coupling is the mechanism through which events in one
region (such as ligand binding) alter the conformation or dynamics of another region (ie. large
conformational domain motions). For example, allostery plays a critical role in cellular signaling, such
as in the transfer of a signal from outside the cell to cytosolic proteins for generating a cellular
response.
</p><!-- l. 29 --><p class='noindent'>While many methods have made tremendous progress in inferring and measuring allosteric
communication using structures or molecular simulations, they rely on a structural view of allostery
and do not account for the role of conformational entropy. Furthermore, it remains a challenge to
interpret allosteric coupling in large, complex biomolecules relevant to physiology and
disease.
</p><!-- l. 31 --><p class='noindent'>In this thesis, I present a method to measure the Correlation of All Rotameric and Dynamical States
(CARDS) which is used to construct and interpret allosteric networks in biological systems.
CARDS allows us to infer allostery both via concerted changes in protein structure and
in correlated changes in conformational entropy (dynamic allostery). CARDS does so
by parsing trajectories into dynamical states which reflect whether a residue is locally
ordered (ie. stable in a single rotameric basin) or disordered (ie. rapidly hopping between
rotamers).
</p><!-- l. 33 --><p class='noindent'>Here I explain <a href='mainch2.html#x7-150002'>the CARDS methodology (chapter 2)</a> and demonstrate applications to a variety of
disease-relevant systems. In particular, I apply CARDS and other sophisticated computational
methods to understand the process of <a href='mainch3.html#x8-330003'>G protein activation (chapter 3)</a>, a protein whose mutations are
linked to cancers such as uveal melanoma. I further demonstrate the utility of CARDS in the <a href='mainch4.html#x9-540004'>study a
potentially druggable pocket in the ebolavirus protein VP35 (chapter 4)</a>. The analyses and models
constructed in this work are supported by experimental testing. Lastly, I demonstrate how integrating
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
MD with experiments, sometimes with the help of citizen-scientists around the world, can provide
unique insight into biological systems and identify potentially useful targets. In particular, I highlight
our recent effort <a href='mainch6.html#x11-890006'>converting Folding@home into an exascale computer platform to hunt for potentially
druggable pockets in the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 (chapter 7)</a> (the cause of the COVID19
pandemic).
