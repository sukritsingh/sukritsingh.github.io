## Welcome to My Github Pages page!

I'm still pretty new to the whole "web development and deployment thing" so 
please bear with me for any ugliness/confusion that may appear on this github
repository. 

This repository is run using Hugo. 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/sukritsingh/sukritsingh.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub I've set up a Github Actions to deploy Hugo to rebuild the pages, from the content in my Markdown files.
